December 5, 2020. SAT day. It was a cloudy and rather chilly Saturday morning. I had stayed up until 3AM the night before, making last-minute edits to my UC Berkeley essays before submitting my application. And yet, there I was, mere minutes away from taking the single most important college admission test on just 5 hours of sleep.

A few of my friends from school had taken the SAT and were applying to USs colleges too, but I would take the test alone that day at the School of the Nations, an elite bilingual private school and makeshift SAT test center in southeastern Brasília. I overheard two girls behind me gloating about how they scored a 1200-something on Khan Academy's SAT practice tests, which kinda threw me off my pre-test

Studying STEM in the United States had been my dream since I was 13. After all, the coolest engineering jobs in the world happen to be in the US: Tesla, SpaceX, Boston Dynamics, NASA/JPL, Boeing, the FAANGs ([MAANGs?](https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-facebook-change-big-techs-faang-considers-toothless-maang-2021-10-29/)), etc. American academics always felt like they had a different "vibe" too—for some reason, studying Math, Physics, CS, Biology, you name it, always seemed more exciting to me when done in English. 

Something felt off that day, though. It was supposed to be exciting. The culmination of all my studying, hard work, and sacrifices leading up to that moment. But I couldn't help but feel queasy, worried, and slightly depressed. What was going on?

## How hard can it be?

Universities in the US are ridiculosly expensive. I would need some serious financial assistance if I were to study there, and being a Brazilian national, my only options was to go big, or go home. Outside of the most prestigious schools, international students rarely have their financial need met by institutional aid awards, which means that unless you're filthy rich, only viable universities for internationals are typically T10s (or T20s at the very least): the Ivy League schools, Stanford, MIT, Caltech, UChicago... you know what I mean.

That in itself is a huge challenge to overcome. Getting admitted to T10s/T20s is already hard enough if you're American, but it's insanely hard as an international student. While I can't verify this, private tutors have told me that T10/T20 acceptance rates could be as low as 1% for Brazilian students. For context: according to [Prep Scholar](https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/MIT-sat-scores-GPA), the average US-based MIT admit has an SAT score of 1535 (that's over 99th percentile!), a 4.17 GPA, and perfect scores in several advanced AP/IB classes. And even then, you've only got a 6% chance of getting in. The average Brazilian MIT admit, on the other hand? In addition to perfect grades, they're also usually a medalist in an international science olympiad, such as [IMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad) (Math), [IPhO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad) (Physics), [IOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics) (Competitive Programming), [IChO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemistry_Olympiad) (Chemistry), etc.

But like, I wasn't a nobody—or at least so I thought. I had a pretty extensive collection of national medals and awards in several Brazilian science competitions, including [OBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olimp%C3%ADada_Brasileira_de_Matem%C3%A1tica) (Math), [OBMEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olimp%C3%ADada_Brasileira_de_Matem%C3%A1tica_das_Escolas_P%C3%BAblicas) (Math for Public Schools), [OBF](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olimp%C3%ADada_Brasileira_de_F%C3%ADsica) (Physics), and [OBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Astronomy_Olympiad) (Astronomy). I played alto sax at my school's marching band for over 6 years and was a member of the Robotics Club. And I loved coding too! Maybe I had got a shot at this after all. I mean, how hard can it be, right...?

Spoiler alert: it was insanely hard.

## Spiraling out of control

I studied for over three years for Brazilian Team Selection Tests for both [Cono Sur](https://sites.google.com/view/conesul2020/home) and IPhO, but I didn't manage to qualify for either. My grades were pretty good (9.5/10 GPA), but they dipped considerably during my 12th grade (it was the peak of COVID pandemic) and I never took any AP tests. I didn't many impressive extracurriculars. And I barely managed to score a 1470 on my SAT practice tests. So faced with these odds, hearing two girls boasting about their good-but-not-great 1200 SATs genuinely bothered me. They're studying at one of the most expensive schools in town, get to attend bilingual classes, and have a dedicated AP curriculum (which isn't widely available outside of the US, mind you), and a 1200 was perfectly fine to them. And I was a public school student with few credentials to back up my ambitions—how would I even stand a chance?

Watching my big hopes and dreams slowly but inevitably slipping out of my hands didn't just hurt my motivation—it made me feel powerless and a complete failure. I was nearly at the end of my high school career and didn't have as much to show for it as I wished. And as you can imagine, hitting your lowest point in the middle of your college applications only worsened this vicious cycle of negativity.

And as much as I've been reluctant to admit that I was sufferring from "[senioritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senioritis)", in hindsight I probably was. It's a silly made-up condition, but it's a pretty accurate description for my subpar 12th grade experience.

## Frustration

If you take what I just said at face value, then my college applications went about as well as you might imagine.

In the end, I applied to seven universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Caltech and UC Berkeley. Now, typically, applying only to extremely competitive schools for would be a recipe for disaster. But then again, financial aid was key here, and these were the only schools that offered any hope of meeting my demonstrated need. I would have loved to have applied to Purdue, Colorado Boulder, Duke, Brown, Johns Hopkins, UCLA, and many others, but couldn't.

But in reality, something unexpected happened. I was actually offered a waitlist spot at three schools: Princeton, Yale, and UC Berkeley.

But what now...?

Getting waitlisted to three top-tier universities was the most bittersweet experience I've ever had in my life. On one hand, these admissions officers somehow decided that I was more fit to join their school than over 95% of applicants, but on the other hand, I didn't receive a single admission letter. Not one. I just didn't make the cut.

Despite my less-than-ideal application package, I'm actually willing to go out on a limb and say that 2020-21 was probably of the worst college admission seasons of recent memory. Sure, that might be highly biased coming from me, but [application numbers surged](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/college-applications-rebounded-by-22percent-this-yearheres-why-.html), [acceptance rates at top colleges plummeted](https://archive.is/kMl8f), and even straight-A students struggled to get into T100s. To make matters worse, a large portion of T100 admits opted to defer their enrollment for an extra year due to COVID (which was still in full swing back then), which essentially crippled any chance of us waitlisted students receiving an offer of admission.


The point is that students were visibly frustrated—and I was one of them. Stories about the [mid-pandemic admissions bloodbath](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ndxe2o/it_was_a_bloodbath/) made the rounds on the [A2C subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/), and I could relate to them on a personal level. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that my waitlist decisions got dragged out all to way to frickin' July. **JULY.** I applied to UC Berkeley in early December and had to wait over 7 months just to receive a big fat "nope". Not cool, Cal.

## Just give up, man

I'm never considered myself to be a quitter—in fact, I like to think that I'm quite a resilient person. Naturally, when faced with failure, I wondered if could try again and still have a chance at making my dream come true, so I asked my then tutor if there was anything I could do differently.

Her answer was an unfortunate "Not really". She didn't completely rule out the possibility of re-applying a year later, but she made clear that it was very unlikely to be accepted at a T10 as a Brazilian after taking a gap year, unless you were involved in extraordinary projects or had an major transformative story to tell. She only really knew of a few concrete cases where this actually happened. 
- A girl from a São Paulo favela helped run a black candidate's campaign for Congresss as a social media manager, which completely changed her outlook on politics, and she later went on to study Political Science. 
- Some dude literally won the [Intel Science Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair?useskin=vector). 
- Another dude took several gap years, invented a low-cost difribilator, took it to trade fairs and even won sponsorships deals from local tech companies. 
- And another girl got a perfect score on the [ENEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio) essay, created a website teaching other students to do the same, and even worked with the governor of the state of Alagoas to secure scholarships for public school students.

Her best advice was to take a step back and do some soul searching and consider applying to schools elsewhere, such as in Canada or Great Britain (even though their financial aid is quite limited). Figure out what type of career I really wanted, decide if a gap year was worth it, etc. If I wanted to get admitted to a T10/T20 in the US, I'd better find some extraordinary thing to put on my resume to wow the admissions officers, or else I wouldn't even stand a chance. Or course, she offered little if any help in trying to point me to what this grandiose acheivement could be, even though she knew my strengths and weaknesses better than anyone. 

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. So all that was left was to give up? Just like that?

That didn't set well with me. At all.

## Brazil has their own JEE?

Even though her advice left me quite hopeless, my tutor had a point: I had to rethink my priorities, and that meant dedicating more time for the Brazilian university admission exams, the so-called [vestibulares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_exam?useskin=vector).

The vestibular is a very peculiar type of test. Like the SATs and ACTs, they're a class of college admission exams usually taken at the end of high school, but that's about where the similarities end. They're often much harder than your run-of-the-mill SATs because they usually go beyond just Math and Languages, often requiring you to study **all** high school subjects, and assigning different weights to each subject depending on what you'll major in. The vestibulares are not centralized, and most universities either develop their own proprietary entry exam, or just rely on the Brazilian Government's standardized offering, the [ENEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio).

And as far as STEM goes, the two most renowned engineeering schools in Brazil, [ITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica?useskin=vector) and [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Militar_de_Engenharia), opted to create their own dedicated entry exams, which are notorius for being the hardest admission tests in the country, with a ridiculously low 2% (or lower!) admission rate. In fact, their vestibulares are surprisingly similar to India's [JEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination?useskin=vector#JEE-Main) or even China's Natural Sciences [Gaokao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao?useskin=vector).

But so what if ITA and IME have tough exams? I'm an accomplished medalist in Brazilian science olympiads, so this isn't my first rodeo with tough tests. Seems doable enough—or so I thought.

The biggest problem with the vestibulares (and similar tests like JEE and Gaokao) is that, by their very nature, they're university _entrance_ exams—not just standardized tests. They're the sole factor used by Brazilian universities to decide whether you get access to higher education or not. Your extracurricular activities and volunteering experience don't mean anything. Your past awards and olympiad medals are reduced to mere proxies of your current academic performance, rather than being an integral part of your student career. Even your high school grades are virtually worthless!

In practice, this means that getting admission to ITA or IME means studying advanced Math, Physics and Chemistry, often forcing you to both relearn basic concepts and learn college-level material at the same time, for several *years* (plural) on end, on a grueling full-time schedule, without distractions or secondary priorities. Needless to say, I didn't really enjoy the thought sacrificing several years of my life to study for a single test that would determine if I was worthy enough of setting foot in a prestigious school. Worse still, letting go of the literal thousands of hours I spent preparing for science olympiads, building coding projects and practicing music would all basically be meaningless.

There was also a considerable pressure from my parents to get admitted to these schools as well, because as luck would have it, ITA just so happened to be my dad's alma mater. And unfortunately, what should've been some much-needed motivation only ended up worsening my already stressful life. I felt that having to resort to the vestibulares was essentially a big "eff you" to everything I've worked so hard to achieve as a student, musician and programmer. 

This gnawing feeling of stagnation was killing me. There had to be another way.
