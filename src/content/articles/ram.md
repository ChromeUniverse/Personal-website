> _I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often  
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping  
Here, take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe off all the  
Sweat, sweat, sweat,  
Lose yourself to dance!_<p style="opacity: 0.5">- Pharrell Williams, _Lose Yourself to Dance_</p>

Everything about this album screams _\~disco\~_. Daft Punk's flashy suits in the promotional material, the music videos for _Get Lucky_ and _Lose Yourself to Dance_, Nile Rodgers' iconic funky rhythm guitar lines, the funky bass lines, the musical production and featured collaborators...

It's a far cry from the sleek, futuristic aesthetic that Daft Punk built with _Discovery_ (nevermind _Human After All_ 's roughness and lack of polish), but _RAM_ was never meant to be the next big thing in electronica. It's a flashback, a blast to past delivered in Daft Punk's authentic and beautifully crafted homage to the sounds and grooves of 70's/80's pop, disco, and synth-funk.

I still plan on writing a full review for this album as soon as I find the time to do so. But in the meantime, stop wasting \*your\* time and go give _RAM_ a listen if you haven't already.
