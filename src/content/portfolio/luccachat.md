**LuccaChat** was built with the main goal of learning how to design, architect, build and deploy an advanced full-stack web application with real-time data subscriptions over WebSockets.

The end result? A feature-rich live chat app with robust [end-to-end type safety](https://zod.dev/), an aesthetically pleasing design, and awesome tech being used across the entire stack, including [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws), [Prisma](https://prisma.io), [PostgreSQL](https://www.prisma.io/), and [more](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/LuccaChat). 

A [full feature list]([feature-rich](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/LuccaChat#features)) is available on LuccaChat's GitHub repo.

While I have no intention to make it a commercially viable product, LuccaChat is still an exceptional tech demo and proof-of-concept that shows how modern programming languages, frameworks, libraries and tooling can be used to build a polished and highly-interactive web app.
