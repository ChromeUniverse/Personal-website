This project is my solution to a free coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). The main goal was to build a social media dashboard page and get it looking as close to the provided design previews as possible.
