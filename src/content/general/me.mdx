**Hi, I'm Lucca!** ‚úåÔ∏è I'm a 20 y/o programmer, musician and student from Bras√≠lia, Brazil üáßüá∑.

I enjoy learning about full-stack web development and building web apps with my favorite technologies, both as a freelance developer and as a hobbyist.

When I'm not coding or studying, I'm often listening to jazz or playing some funky basslines.

I've been working as a freelance Discord bot developer since December 2021. Through my freelance work, I help both small businesses and invididuals alike take their Discord communities to the next level by developing highly customized and easy-to-use Discord bots.

I have built and shipped a wide variety of custom bots, including server management tools for mods and admins, full-fledged Ethereum blockchain integrations and, of course, some fun games too.

More recently, however, I have been looking to gradually shift my focus over to frontend/full-stack web development projects, as that's what I enjoy doing most.

## Academics

### Col√©gio Militar de Bras√≠lia

CMB (Military School of Bras√≠lia) is federal public school in Bras√≠lia, Federal District. I studied there from 6th grade all the way to 12th grade, graduating High School in December 2020 in the top 5% of my class of 530+ students. I was admitted to CMB in 6th grade (2014), when I ranked 3rd on CMB's extremely competitive admission test, where over 1100 candidates competed for just 30 spots reserved for civilian students.

Despite the school's strict rules and strong Brazilian military traditions, CMB holds a very special place my heart for allowing me to make life-long friendships and for motivating me to work hard both in and out of the classroom.
