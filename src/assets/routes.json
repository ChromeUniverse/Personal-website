This eventually turned into [_The Box World_](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/The-Box-World), a Club Penguin-like lounge game where you can create rooms, invite your friends, walk around and chat with your buddies by sending messages in the room chat.\n\nAround the same time, I happened to find a pretty neat .io game, [TankRoyale.io](https://tankroyale.io/), and it didn't take me long to realize that I might be able build my own version with the technologies that I already knew. So that's exactly what I did, and thus _**Tank Battle**_ was born!\n\nOver the next couple of months, I would work on the project sporadically, implementing cool features, learning tons of new things, and of course, breaking my code hundreds of times, doing complete project rewrites, and debugging all sorts of unforeseen issues. Nevertheless, I managed to power through it all and finally completed the game in early October of 2021. \n\nAs of writing this, _Tank Battle_ is online and you can check it out [here](http://18.229.196.24:4000/).\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/895442475278274580/unknown.png?width=1343&height=665)\n\n<p class=\"img-caption\"> <i>Tank Battle</i> game room with two players </p>\n\n> **Table of Contents**\n> - [Goals](#goals)  \n> - [How I built it](#how-i-built-it)  \n>   - [Frontend](#frontend)  \n>   - [Backend](#backend)  \n> - [New technologies that I learned](#new-technologies-that-i-learned)  \n>   - [Node.js/Express backend](#nodejsexpress-backend)  \n>   - [User authentication](#user-authentication)  \n>   - [Relational Databases with SQL](#relational-databases-with-sql)  \n>   - [Async programming](#async-programming)  \n>   - [Client-Server game model](#client-server-game-model)  \n>   - [Elo Rating System (Simple Multiplayer Elo)](#elo-rating-system-simple-multiplayer-elo)  \n> - [Next Steps](#next-steps)  \n>   - [Mitigating Lag](#mitigating-lag)  \n>   - [Improving the UI/UX](#improving-the-uiux)  \n> - [Conclusion](#conclusion)  \n\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\nBefore I began this long and arduous web/game development journey, my primary goal was just to get a small prototype working to show off to my friends. However, as with literally any software side project ever, [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) started to kick in. \n\nI started thinking to myself: what features and technologies could I add to make this game cooler? The project's scope grew quickly and my goals started expanding. How about a fully fledged database? Maybe even a user authentication system? An API for fetching leaderboard rankings, player stats and user data? Things like that. \n\nEven without any prior experience in any of those things, eventually I decided that these extra features added useful fucntionality to the \"end product\", so to speak, and warranted some extra blood, sweat and tears to bring them to life. And so, [filled with detemmienation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9KKnll-RN0), I added them to my to-do list and started implementing some extra spicy features to the game.\n\nIn the end, these were the final goals I decided on:\n\n* Real-time communication over [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) with a simple message exchange model\n* Graphics with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\n* Game rooms that anyone can create and join \n* Game matches/rounds with a match state lifecycle:\n  * Waiting: waits for a minium number of players to join\n  * Pre-match: lasts a couple of seconds before starting the match starts\n  * Match running: the actual game itself\n  * Post-match: lasts a couple of seconds before after the match ends\n* Award points to the players at the end of each match\n* An [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)-like rating system and a public leaderboard\n* Simple and secure user signup/login system with [JWTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBUNrFtufWo) and password [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)/[salting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))\n* A [SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjvFFKOm3c&t=56s) database with a basic schema for storing user data\n* A simple and funtional but aesthetically pleasing UI with only vanilla HTML and CSS\n* Frontend written entirely in vanilla JS - no additional libraries expect when absolutely necessary\n\nFortunately, I was actually able to meet nearly 100% of the goals I had outlined for this project, even the ones that were added to the to-do list during the later stages of development. As a guy who still sees himself as an \"advanced beginner\" programmer, seeing this project through to the end was incredibly rewarding and satisfying.\n\n![\"oh, what, wow, he's the greatest dancer\"](https://c.tenor.com/fJh-W38iA3oAAAAC/dance-kid.gif)\n<p class=\"img-caption\"> tfw you finish your cool new online game </p>\n\n---\n\n## How I built it\n\nSince _Tank Battle_ is essentially another fullstack web app created by yours truly, you can definitely expect some of the usual suspects to be driving the inner workings of this project. However, there are a couple of very important special guests this time round, without whom this project wouldn't be complete.\n\n### Frontend\n\nAs with all my web dev projects so far, I'm using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS on the frontend. No fancy frameworks like React/Vue/Angular here.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/895500676749213776/unknown.png?width=739&height=665)\n\n<p class=\"img-caption\"><i>Tank Battle</i> Home Page</p>\n\nThe frontend code is also pretty straightforward - most of it is just HTTP requests made with the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and DOM manipulation with vanilla JS.\n\nOther that that, there's only two other special things I'd like to note here. Firstly, (and as I've said before) I'm using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the graphics in the game room page - this includes doing things like drawing the rooms, players, bullets, obstacles and game prompts. Secondly, I'm using the native browser [WebSockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) for exchanging JSON-encoded messages over WebSockets with the main game server. (an alternative to this would be a library like [socket.io](https://socket.io/)).\n\n<!-- If you've never heard of p5.js before, in a lot of ways it's basically [Processing](https://processing.org/) for the web browser - you can use it to draw almost anything on an HTML canvas and even make some fun animations. -->\n\n\n### Backend\n\nBuilding the frontend for _Tank Battle_ was a relatively simple task - all I had to do was build a minimal UI with vanilla HTML and CSS and and write some code to perform a couple of HTTP requests. But building a reliable, feature-rich, modular and easily maintainable backend though, that was the real challenge here.\n\nOf course, since I've now become a Certified JavaScript Simp™, I absolutely refuse to use anything other than [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for my web apps' backend. In this case, I'm running two completely independent Node servers.\n\nOne of them acts as the main [webserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server), powered by the good ol' [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework. It's responsible for a large part of _Tank Battle_'s core functionality, including:\n\n* Serving static files (mostly client-side scripts, stylesheets and a favicon) with the [Express static file middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)\n\n* Handling API requests for leaderboard rankings and user data using the [Express Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)\n\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/895442180104126544/unknown.png?width=730&height=665)\n\n<p class=\"img-caption\"> <i>Tank Battle</i> Leaderboard </p>\n\n\n* Connecting to a MySQL 8.0 database with a connection pool and perform SQL queries using [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)\n\n* Authenticating users with [JSON Web Tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)\n\n* Creating new player accounts and keeping their passwords safe by hashing and salting them with [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) before storing them in the MySQL database.\n\nThe other Node program is the main game server. It acts as a WebSockets server and also runs all of the game logic. Out of the two Node servers, the main game server is the one doing the heavylifting here, including:\n\n* Handling all of the near real-time bidirectional communication by exchanging messages with clients (i.e. players and spectators) over Websockets using the [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websockets) package.\n\n* Managing the internal states of all game rooms, including room metadata (number of players, current match state, etc.), spectators, players, obstacles, and bullets.\n\n* Running the main game loop, which consists of:\n\n  * Updating the match state for all game rooms according to the match state lifecycle (i.e. switching between \"Waiting for players to join\", \"Pre-match\", \"Match running\", \"Post-match\" states when appropriate)\n\n  * Receiving user inputs and queueing them up for later processing - this includes player movement, shots, room spectation and room join requests.\n\n  * Running all game physics - this includes player motion, projectile motion and ricochets (i.e. reflecting off walls and obtacle edges), and collision detection between different entities (players, solid obstacles, bullets, room walls)\n\n  * Sending the current game state back to all players and spectators in all rooms\n\n\nA very important aspect that made the game's backend **waaay** easier to work on is being able to [split your app into multiple files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9M-rlbWc8). This might sound trivial, but separating your app logic into discrete, manageable units allows you to plan your system at a higher level first and get into the nitty-gritty coding later, which is essential for larger projects like _Tank Battle_. Using multiple files makes your code easier to maintain and expand on in the future, and it's a lot less distracting.\n\nThe backend is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance (a free-tier eligible one, of course!) located in São Paulo, in order to minimize latency. Most of the people who will try out _Tank Battle_ are most likely going to be relatives or close friends of mine who live here in Brazil anyways, so I might as well deploy my app to a nearby host.\n\nIf you'd like to self-host your own version of _Tank Battle_, I've got detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Tank-Battle).\n\n---\n\n## New technologies that I learned\n\n_Tank Battle_ is by far the most complex and demanding software project I've worked on to date. I've learned **a lot** of really cool things during the game's development cycle, and honestly, I would've never thought I would have accomplished all of this.\n\n### Node.js/Express backend\n\nI've been using the Node.js + Express combo for literally 100% of my web projects for the past year and so far it's worked remarkably well. This time round, though, I found that using the [Express Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router) made a _huge_ difference in making my webserver code more modular and maintainable by splitting all of the route logic into separate files. \n\nThe Router also proved to be very useful for making a simple API. It only has a couple of endpoints, notably, `/lb`, which returns a JSON with the leaderboard data, and `/user`, which returns a JSON with player stats.\n\nI also got to try out some very useful npm packages, like [`bcrypt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for secure password storage, [`mysql2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) for querying data from a MySQL database, [`jsonwebtoken`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) for user authentication, [`validator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) for validating user emails, [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for environment variables, and more.\n\n### User authentication\n\nAuthentication systems for web services are notoriously difficult to implement by yourself in a production setting. If you plan on shipping your code as part of an actual product, you'll most likely have to use an Identity-as-a-Service provider like Google's [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [Cognito](https://auth0.com/) by AWS, etc (take a look at this [great article](https://withblue.ink/2020/04/08/stop-writing-your-own-user-authentication-code.html) by Alessando Segala for more on this). That being said, since _Tank Battle_ isn't a serious product (like, at all), I can totally get away with just using [JSON Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWT) and [web cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) for user auth. \n\nWhen a user fills out the login form, the browser makes a `POST` request to `/login` with a JSON containing the the user's username and password. Once the webserver receives the request, it checks the database to see if the username/password combination is valid, in which case it will send a JWT inside a cookie back to the user's browser. \n\nWhile this approach _might_ be prone to a [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attack, it's simple and quite effective, and any vulnerabilities should be mitigated by using the `HttpOnly`, `SameSite` and `Secure` cookie attributes. \n\n\n### Relational Databases with SQL\n\nI took this opportunity to try out the [SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjvFFKOm3c&t=56s) language and a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS) system for the first time. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to get started with SQL too, I highly suggest following Khan Academy's awesome [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course. Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\nWhen it comes to setting up an actual SQL database for your app, though, two common open-source options come to mind: [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) and [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite). These are completely different relational database systems: while MySQL is a fully-fledged program (i.e. a database server) that requires a local or remote TCP connection in order to connect to the database and perform SQL queries, a SQLite database is contained entirely inside a single file. For more on MySQL vs. SQlite, take a look at this [comparison](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-whats-the-difference/) by Hostinger. \n\nIn the end, I chose MySQL Server 8.0 as it's more commonly used with Node.js than SQLite. As far as Node packages go, I'm using [`mysql2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to MySQL (don't forget to use [connection pooling](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/issues/939#issuecomment-932748114)!) and perform queries. You could also use an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like [`sequelize`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), which works well with lots of different flavors of SQL, including MySQL, SQLite and others.\n\nIf you're looking for a tutorial on how to setup MySQL Server on your system, then check out this awesome [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04) from DigitalOcean or this great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz3WcZLRaWc) from Fireship on YouTube. \n\n\n### Async programming\n\nBeing able to write asynchronous code is a necessity for any web application in the 21st century. Present-day JS (both server-side and client-side) already have support for modern `async`/`await` syntax since the introduction of ECMAScript 2017. Many Node frameworks and libraries like Express, `ws`, `mysql2` and `jsonwebtoken` make extensive use of Promises and async functions.\n\n\n### Client-Server game model\n\nThe core of the client-server architecture that's powering _Tank Battle_ is heavily inspired by a series of fantastic articles from [Gabriel Gambetta](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/), a senior software engineer at Google Zürich, titled [Fast-Paced Multiplayer](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html). \n\nHe explains the basics of the [Client-Server game architecture](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) and proposes the use of an authoritative server and \"dumb\" clients as the basis for making online multiplayer games, in addition to describing techniques such as [client-side prediction](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html), [server reconciliation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html), [entity interpolation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/entity-interpolation.html), and [lag compensation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/lag-compensation.html) to minimize lag in online games.\n\nIf you're interested in making your own online multiplayer games as well, I highly recommend reading Gambetta's articles - they're remarkably well written and explain challenging technical concepts in a clear manner. They helped me a lot while I was building _Tank Battle_'s main game server. Kudos to you, Mr. Gambetta!\n\n### Elo Rating System (Simple Multiplayer Elo)\n\nThe [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) was created in the 1960s by Hungarian-American physics professor [Arpad Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpad_Elo) for rating FIDE chess players, but nowadays Elo-based ratings system are widely used in [MMOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game) as a means to quantify a specefic player's \"true\" abilities and to predict how well they will fare against other players. \n\nA very popular Elo-based system in use today is Microsoft's [TrueSkill rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill). Being proprietary software, though, you'd have to pay Big M some hefty dough to get a license to use TrueSkill in your own project. Fortunately, Tom Kerrigan, an independent iOS app developer from Seattle, WA, created a much simpler (and free!) implementation of a multiplayer rating system which he calls [Simple Multiplayer Elo](http://www.tckerrigan.com/Misc/Multiplayer_Elo/). Here's how he describes it:\n\n<blockquote>\nI've come up with a simple and effective way to apply the two-player Elo system to multiplayer scenarios: \n<ul>\n<li>At the end of a game, make a list of all the players and sort it by performance.   </li>\n<li>Think of each player as having played two matches: a loss vs. the player right above him on the list, and a win vs. the player right below him.   </li>\n<li>Update each player's rating accordingly using the two-player Elo equations.   </li>\n</ul>\nI call this method \"Simple Multiplayer Elo\" (SME) and am making it public domain.  \n</blockquote>\n\nImplementing SME from scratch is very straightforward - all you need is to loop over your ranked list of players and run the classic Elo algorithm on pairs of players in a \"top-down\" manner: first players 1 and 2, then players 2 and 3, etc. The reverse (\"bottom-up\") approach (first players `n` and `n-1`, then players `n-1` and `n-2`, etc.) will yield very similar results (although not exactly the same as \"top-down\").\n\nTo be honest, I'm not very good when it comes to statistics, so I can't argue on how SME fares agaisnt other ratings systems. Tom claims that his system \"approaches ideal accuracy much faster than TrueSkill. Eventually TrueSkill produces ratings that are almost perfect (after hundreds of rounds) but at that point the difference is marginal\".\n\nIf you're using SME in your project, be sure to send an [email](mailto:tom.kerrigan@gmail.com) to Tom! He's a chill dude.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nEven though _Tank Battle_ is, for all intents and purposes, a done deal, there are two very important aspects of this project that I'd consider revisiting in the near-ish future.\n\n### Mitigating Lag\n\nIronically, one of the game's biggest shortcomings is also one of its main \"selling points\": networking. If the players have slow internet, or are on opposite sides of the Earth, the game can suffer from lag. Sometimes, it can render the game totally unplayable, even for players with decent broadband.\n\nBut as I've mentioned earlier, one of the main topics that Mr. Gambetta discusses in his [Fast-Paced Multiplayer](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) articles are implementations of techniques to minimize lag in online games, such as [client-side prediction](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html), [server reconciliation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-server-reconciliation.html), [entity interpolation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/entity-interpolation.html), and [lag compensation](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/lag-compensation.html), which could drastically improve the game's networking performance. \n\nUnfortunately, adding these extra features to game will be quite time-consuming, and I think this project has already reached its [point of diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) with respect to development time and the sense of self-accomplishment that I get from working on it.\n\n### Improving the UI/UX\n\nIn its current state, the game's UI does the bare minimum of what it need to do. I managed to implement a somewhat consistent design across the game's webpages, but that could certainly use some work - the website as a whole just feels kind of hacked together and unpolished. \n\nI also learned the hard way that HTML DOM manipulation with vanilla JS is ridiculously tedious. I'm guessing libraries like [JQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) could help, but I wanted to build my frontend without any extra libraries (as stated in the project's goals). Even so, it might be high time to try out a proper frontend framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/) to minimize these headaches in future projects.\n\n--- \n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, I'd say that working on _Tank Battle_ has a been a very positive experience, despite the sheer amount of time that it took to finish this project. I learned a lot of really cool stuff though, so I hope I can find similarly interesting and challenging projects to tackle in the next couple of months. \n\nOver the course of making this game, I've come to realize that web apps are still the undisputed king of software in the 2020's and that's not going to change anytime soon. Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, Google Docs, Twitch, Spotify, and even VS Code are all web apps made for browsers or that have been adapted as native desktop apps (using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), for instance) or mobile apps. \n\nBeing a competent web dev will ensure that your apps and ideas can reach a massive pool of potential users, so learning web technologies is an absolute must for the up-and-coming software engineer. Plus, companies are still [offering a LOT of money](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/web-developer/salary) for expert web dev ninjas.\n\nThat being said, as someone who hasn't even started college yet, I'm not sure I'd be happy working as a full-time web developer. Sure, having that sort of skillset is very valuable (and honestly, pretty awesome too), but surely there must be cooler things to do than styling webpages with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or choosing the best [React State](https://areknawo.com/top-5-react-state-management-libraries-in-late-2020/) library, whatever the hell that means.\n\nDoing web dev for _Tank Battle_ has been fun, but I'm looking forward to exploring other things now. Maybe some low-level C/C++ coding on microcontrollers? Studying computer [ISAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)? Embedded Linux? Something else? Honestly, I don't know. Guess we'll have to see. If you've somehow made it this far, [I'd love to hear your suggestions](mailto:omnichrome2@gmail.com).\n\n**Thanks for reading!** Lucca out. ✌"},"discovery":{"meta":{"title":"Album review: _Discovery_","templates":[],"groups":[],"description":"My review of the revolutionary sophomore album from French electronic dance duo Daft Punk, released in 2001.\n","album-embed":"<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2noRn2Aes5aoNVsU6iWThc\" width=100% height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n","date":"2021-05-27T11:30:00.000Z"},"md":" \n> _Music's got me feeling so free   \nWe're gonna celebrate  \nCelebrate and dance so free  \nOne more time!_<p style=\"opacity: 0.5\">- Romanthony, _One More Time_</p>\n\nArguably the best album ever made by Daft Punk.

A simple workflow for a building a Node.js app would look something like this:\n\n```yaml\nname: Node.js CI\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        node-version: [10.x, 12.x, 14.x, 15.x]\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n        with:\n          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm run build --if-present\n      - run: npm test\n\n```\n\nNotice how the [syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for these workflow files is quite human-readable and reasonably simple to understand, even if you don't have any prior experience with Actions.\n\nI'm not going into too much detail about what the workflow above does - for that, you can read [this great tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-github-actions-and-how-can-you-automate-tests-and-slack-notifications/) from freeCodeCamp for a step-by-step breakdown - instead, I'd like to use this post to describe a practical use case for GitHub Actions and how I set up an automated build/deploy workflow for the website that you're using right now to read this article.\n\n---\n\n## Actions workflow for my personal website\n\nI set up Actions to automate the webpage compilation process and deployment of this website. My full workflow file is available [here](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/compile-deploy.yaml). \n\n```yaml \n#\n# This is a GitHub Workflow for building and deploying my personal website.\n# A generous supply of comments is included with this workflow.\n#\n# Author: Lucca Rodrigues\n#\n \nname: Build and deploy website\n\non: \n  push:\n    branches: \n      # Main branch\n      - main\n      # Testing branch\n      - test\n\njobs:\n\n  # compile webpages \n  build-and-deploy:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n\n    # Check out code\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    # Node.js setup\n    - name: Setting up Node.js!\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v1    \n      with:\n        node-version: 14.x\n\n    # Install packages with NPM\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: npm ci\n\n    # Compile webpages\n    - name: Compile all webpages\n    \n      # NOTE: specify server address - in this case, it's 34.200.98.64:3000\n      run: node compiler.js 34.200.98.64:3000\n\n    # Creating SSH private key\n    - name: Create SSH identity file\n\n      # Get BASE64-encoded private key stored in repo secret\n      env:        \n        DEPLOYMENTKEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYKEY }}\n\n      # Decode with BASE64, change permissions with chmod        \n      run: | \n        echo \"$DEPLOYMENTKEY\" | base64 --decode  >deployment.key\n        chmod 400 deployment.key\n\n    # Rsync over SSH\n    - name: Sync files with AWS Lightsail      \n\n      # Login with deployment.key\n      run: \n        rsync -zaPv -e \"ssh -v -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i deployment.key\" ./ ubuntu@34.200.98.64:~/Personal-website/\n     \n```\n\n\nHere's what my action is basically doing:\n\n1. It's triggered by pushes to the `main` or `test` branches\n\n2. It compiles the webpages by running [this script](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website/blob/main/compiler.jss) and generates the website's HTMLs\n\n4. Generates an identity file to log in to a remote AWS Lightsail server via SSH (yes, surprisingly, it is possible to use Actions to log in to remote hosts)\n\n5. Syncs files with the remote host using [Rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) over SSH\n\nLet's breakdown these steps:\n\n### 1. Events\n\nThis is basically as simple as it gets when it comes to [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on). Events are specified with the `on:` keyword. My workflow starts running when pushes are made to either the `main` or `test` branches.\n\n```yaml\non: \n  push:\n    branches: \n      # Main branch\n      - main\n      # Testing branch\n      - test\n```\n\n### 2. Webpage compilation\n\nMy webpage compiler is a JS script which takes my Markdown-formatted posts, fetches some HTML and CSS templates, and converts them to HTMLs ready to be served by my main webserver. It needs Node.js and a couple of dependencies to run - thankfully, there's already a specific action for installing Node and NPM with GitHub actions, [setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).\n\nBoth the compiler and Git commit/pushes run on the `build` job.\n\nA couple of quick notes on jobs:\n* You need to specify the operating system that each job will run on. I always choose Ubuntu Linux for simplicity's sake.\n\n* If your job needs to access your source code (for running tests, compiling, building, etc.), you'll need to use the [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action to get your code into the workflow runner.\n\n* Each job has a sequence of tasks called `steps`. Each `step` can have only one `run` statement, but you can run always run multiple commands by using `run: |` and a multiline sequence of commands, with one command per line.\n\n```yaml\n# compile webpages \nbuild-and-deploy:\n\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n  steps:\n\n  # Check out code\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n  # Node.js setup\n  - name: Setting up Node.js!\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v1    \n    with:\n      node-version: 14.x\n\n  # Install packages with NPM\n  - name: Install dependencies\n    run: npm ci\n\n  # Compile webpages\n  - name: Compile all webpages\n    # NOTE: specify server address - in this case, it's 34.200.98.64:3000\n    run: node compiler.js 34.200.98.64:3000\n```\n\nIn the workflow snippet above, I've told the runner to install Node.js version 14, install my NPM packages with `npm ci`, and run my webpage compiler with the address of this webpage as an argument (I've added this feature to make it easier to compile webpages for both local development and deployment).\n\n### 3. Creating an SSH identity file\n\nSince I couldn't find any existing actions for deploying to AWS Lightsail (my VPS of choice), I chose to deploy my website the \"hard\" way: use SSH to log in to my Lightsail instance and then run whatever commands I need to on the remote host. \n\nThe really cool thing about doing it the \"hard\" way is that you can use it for deploying code to just about any VPS and any cloud service provider, not just AWS' Lightsail or EC2 machines. You could most certainly use this same approach for VPSes from Linode, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean or even a self-hosted server of your own, like a Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nI originally discovered about this method in [this post](https://blog.bugout.dev/2020/06/19/using-github-actions-to-deploy-to-aws-lightsail/) by Neeraj Kashyap of the [bugout.dev](https://blog.bugout.dev/) blog. In the article, he mentions this [great guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh) by Linode **(which you should definitely read ASAP)** on how to properly generate and setup SSH public/private key pairs with `ssh-keygen`.\n\nIn short, after generating your SSH private key, you'll encode it with Base64 and [store the encoded key as a _secret_ in your GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) (read below for more on secrets). On Mac/Linux, you can use the `base64` command to encode your private SSH key - chances are it's called `id_rsa`. Be sure to use `-w0` to remove line breaks:\n\n```sh\nlucca@ThinkBook-13s:~$ base64 -w0 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n\n[Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) are super handy for hiding oh-so-precious auth tokens for APIs and Discord bots, SSH keys, credentials such as username/password combinations and other sensitive data. Your workflow can fetch the secret, decode it and use it to generate an identity file on the runner to use it as a private key for SSH login.\n\nSome additional notes:\n* Since jobs in a workflow run in parallel by default, you'll need to use the `needs:` keyword to specify the other jobs that should before the current one.\n\n* You'll need to use `chmod` to make the identify file readable by the root user, at least - something like `chmod 400` should work just fine.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n \n  build-and-deploy:    \n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n\n    #\n    # ...\n    #\n\n    # Creating SSH private key\n    - name: Create identity file\n\n      # Get BASE64-encoded private key stored in secret\n      env:        \n        DEPLOYMENTKEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYKEY }}\n\n      # Decode with BASE64, change permissions with chmod        \n      run: | \n        echo \"$DEPLOYMENTKEY\" | base64 --decode  >deployment.key\n        chmod 400 deployment.key\n```\n\n\n### 4. Syncing files with Rsync\n\nFinally, the runner uses the `rsync` command to transfer the newly compiled webpages to the remote host. \n\nThe cool thing about `rsync` is that it checks the source and destination directories (which can also be located inside the same machine!) for missing files and only transfers those instead of copying files are already on the destination path.\n\n_If you're looking for a practical introduction to `rynsc`, then check out [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE77MbDnljA) by Corey Schafer._\n\n```sh\nrsync -zaPv -e \"ssh -v -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i deployment.key\" ./ ubuntu@34.200.98.64:~/Personal-website/\n```\n\nThe above command is pretty verbose, so let's unpack it, little by little:\n\n* `rsync` - this is the name of the command.\n\n* **Flag** `-z` **(compress)** - this flag uses compression to send the files to the remote host. \n\n* **Flag** `-a` **(archive)** - this flag maintains the files' read/write/execute permissions while being sent.\n\n* **Flag** `-P` **(progress)** - this flag displays the progress of the file transfer.\n\n* **Flag** `-e` **(remote shell)** - this flag... actually, I'm not totally sure what this flag does, but what I do know is that we can use it to specify an SSH identity file to log in to the remote host securely with SSH.\n\n  ```sh\n  ssh -v -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i deployment.key\n  ```\n  This `ssh` command also contains a number of options which, quite, honestly, I don fully understand what they do. The important flag here is `-i` which specifies the identity file we just created in the previous step.\n\n* **Source path** - this is the path to the original files. In our case, this would be the runner's current working directory, `./`\n\n* **Destination path** - this is the path to where the files should be transferred. In this case, this would be the remote host's `~/Personal-website/` directory, which is where I cloned my website's git repo. Since I'm transferring to a remote host with a username of `ubuntu` and a hostname of `34.200.98.64`, so the full path would be `ubuntu@34.200.98.64:~/Personal-website/`.\n\n\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n \n  build-and-deploy:    \n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n\n    #\n    # ...\n    #\n\n    # Rsync over SSH\n    - name: Sync files with AWS Lightsail      \n\n      # Login with deployment.key\n      run: \n        rsync -zaPv -e \"ssh -v -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i deployment.key\" ./ ubuntu@34.200.98.64:~/Personal-website/\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd that's it! The above workflow can easily compile and deploy my entire website ✨automagically✨. So far it's been working flawlessly.\n\nGitHub Actions seems to be quite a really powerful tool for more complex software projects and I'm looking forward to reading the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to explore some more advanced features.\n\nI'll definetely be using Actions workflows on some of my other projects. In fact, I'm currently writing some tests for [RedstoneBot](https://chromeuniverse.github.io/RedstoneBot) (a [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) bot) with [distest](https://distest.readthedocs.io/) and I plan on creating a CI/CD pipeline to automate building, integration testing and deployment for my bot.

[The static webpage generator](#the-static-webpage-generator)    \n8. [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## A brief introduction\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don't have any experience at all when it comes to building websites. I've never tried services like Squarespace, Wix or Wordpress, and I've yet to try using a \"real\" static website generator like Jekyll or Hugo, but I've heard that these tools/services can yield some pretty nice results. In fact, a good friend of mine who's also a programmer uses Hugo on [his personal website](https://bykoga.com/) and it ended up looking very unique and quite spiffy!\n\nBut instead of diving straight into learning how to to use some sort of website making tool, I wanted to try building something that was truly my own. I wanted something that had just the right balance of control and expandability - something that I gave me almost complete control over my website, but at the same time would give me the flexibility to add libraries and extra features as I saw fit. Or in other words, I basically wanted to build my website (both frontend and backend) from scratch.\n\nI have some experience building basic full-stack web applications with [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/), but no experience so far with frontend libraries like React, Angular or Vue. Naturally I chose Node as my backend and I decided to write all of the frontend stuff in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\n\n---\n\n## My vision \n\nContent-wise, I wanted a reasonably simple website for displaying a couple of blog-style posts in which I could talk about anything to my heart's content: music, coding, science, technology, you name it.\n\nI wanted to build a system that made it ease for me to write new posts without having to mess around with complicated databases, preferably by only creating/editing a single plaintext file. Extra libraries (both frontend and backend) had to be kept to a minimum to reduce complexity. Any extra NPM packages or frameworks better have a really good reason to consume any extra space on my hard drive.\n\nAnd for whoever might be consuming content on this website, I wanted them to be greeted with something that was minimalist in nature to avoid distractions, but still somewhat aesthetically pleasing. I also wanted to build something that made it easy to browse posts and topics easily and quickly, in the case that the reader wished to do so.\n\n---\n\n## The solution \n\nTo meet these goals, I came up with the following system.\n\nMy website uses a custom-built static site generator ([What's that?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3INXQ_4W42g)) which takes in plaintext files with post content and metadata, adds some CSS templates, and generates all of the HTMLs for the website. The generator is a (reasonably) simple script written in JavaScript that runs in Node.js. The files are served by a Node.js + [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) static file webserver. All of the static files and the webserver are hosted on a basic AWS Lightsail instance running Ubuntu 20.04, which costs a meager $4 USD/month to run. I've also set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automatically building and deploying my website to AWS, which you can read more about [here](/gh-actions-website).\n\n_Note: I'll be often referring to the static site generator as a \"compiler\", because that's just the name I chose for the script -_ \"[`compiler.js`](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website/blob/main/compiler.js)\" - and because it does sort of act like a compiler by \"compiling\" the posts into actual webpages.\n\nEven though Express.js is quite a chonky Node.js library, it's by far the simplest web framework I've ever used. It's ridiculously easy to use, and I love how trivial it is to setup Express as a static file server and to create custom routes. \n\n_**Unpopular opinion/Digression**: Django's \"all batteries included\" approach quite honestly **sucks** and is very alienating for beginner web developers (like myself), even if you're an intermediate Python programmer with a couple of years of experience under your belt (...like myself). You'll quickly find yourself constantly switching between a huge amount of additional (read: unnecessary) files, even if all you want to do is setup a minimal webserver. Flask and Express.js did it **way** better - change my mind._\n\nAs far as the actual posts go, I chose to go with Markdown (.md) files which contain both metadata in YAML and actual text content written in Markdown. The compiler script splits the file in half and parses the YAML with [JS-YAML](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) to extract the metadata and the actual text with [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) to convert Markdown into pure HTML, which can be rendered by a web browser.\n\nMarkdown makes it super duper easy to write nicely formatted text with headers, section, subsections, links, images, etc. It's much less cumbersome than raw HTML and writing and formatting text-based content, but since it can't be rendered by a browser, it needs to be converted to HTML somehow first, which is where Marked.js comes in.\n\n---\n\n## Creating posts\n\nNew posts are created by simply creating a new Markdown (.md) file in a specific directory and populating it with: \n* a YAML front matter (basically a header with some metadata) in a similar manner to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the post's title, templates, groups and publishing date, like so:\n\n  ```yaml\n  ---\n  title: Welcome to my webpage!\n  templates: []\n  groups: [all, website]\n  date: 2021-05-27 10:30:00\n  --- \n  ```\n\n* And then, some regular Markdown content:\n\n  ```markdown\n  Hi, I'm Lucca and this is my personal webpage.\n\n  Here you'll find lots of programming, music, electronics and life shenanigans.\n\n  Check the sidebar to the left for essays, posts, project write-ups, interesting/relevant links and more.\n\n  Wanna see how this website was built? [Check out the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/personal-website)\n  ```\n\nAfter running the compiler, something like this will be generated, written to an HTML file and will be ready to served by the Node.js webserver:\n\n![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/848589820125249566/unknown.png)\n\nNot bad, right? \n\nAfter the post was generated and deployed, readers can view it by visiting `mywebsiteurl.net/post-name`.\n\nNotice how the title is clearly displayed at the top with a big, readable font and a horizontal line that makes it stand out from the rest of the post. The date in which the post was made and groups in which the post belongs are neatly shown under the horizontal line in unobtrusive italicized text with a gray color.\n\nThis system certainly accomplishes the goal of making it really easy to write and update posts, but I think the true beauty comes from the fact that all the information is neatly stored in a single human-readable plaintext file rather than a database or some other obscure format.\n\n---\n\n## Templates\n\nThe compiler has a basic templating engine in the form of stylesheets and Markdown/HTML content templates.\n\nTemplates can be applied to a post by specifying the template's filename in the `templates` list in the post's front matter. The file needs to be located in the project's `/public/templates/` directory _(check example below)_. \n\nBy default, two base templates called `base.html` and `base.css` are included with every single page. Pages for displaying posts in a specific group also include the `group.css` template (more on that in the \"Groups\" section below).\n\nI even made a nifty template for fetching GitHub READMEs! You can see it in action for yourself [here](http://localhost:3000/boxworld). Now I don't have to redo my old project write-ups! 😄\n\n```yaml\n---\ntemplates: [github-fetch.md]\ngroups: [all, github-readme, me]\ngithub-url: https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-Website \ndate: 2021-05-27 14:33:00\n---\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `base.html`, `base.css` and `github-fetch.md` templates will be included with the post.\n\n---\n\n## Groups\n\n\"Groups\" basically work like tags for the posts.\n\nPosts can be filtered by groups by simply visiting `mywebsiteurl.net/group-name`, which will display all posts that belong in the group _group-name_, sorted from newest to oldest. For example, if I wanted to see all posts that belong to the \"music\" group, I would go to [`mywebsiteurl.net/music`](/music).\n\nGroups are assigned to posts by specifying which groups that post should belong to in the `groups` list in the post's front matter.\n\n```yaml\ntitle: My thoughts on Daft Punk's _Random Access Memories_\ntemplates: []\ngroups: [all, album-review, music, daft-punk]\ndate: 2021-05-27 12:00:00\n``` \n\nThe example post above would show up in the _all_, _album-review_, _music_ and _daft-punk_ groups.\n\n\n## Description\n\nThe post's author can specify a description for the post in the YAML front matter. The description's text will be displayed in group page previews and will appear on the post page's \n`<meta name=\"description\" content=\"\">` tag.\n\n```yaml\ntitle: My thoughts on Daft Punk's _Random Access Memories_\ntemplates: []\ngroups: [all, album-review, music, daft-punk]\ndescription: |\n  My review of Daft Punk's 2013 full-length LP, Random Access Memories.\ndate: 2021-05-27 12:00:00\n``` \n\nIn the example post above, there's a short summary about the post's content: \"My review of Daft Punk's 2013 full-length LP, Random Access Memories\".\n\n\n---\n\n## The static webpage generator \n\nMy website generator (\"compiler\") is quite limited in what it can do, but it's the one doing the heavylifting behind this website. It gets the job done, and it's proven to be quite easy to maintain and expand on. It's a relatively simple Node.js script which I have set up to run using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). Nodemon watches for changes in post files and template files and re-runs the compiler on every file save.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n* **Content**: First, the generator fetches the post's actual content. Since it's still in plain Markdown, it reads the content and parses it with Marked.js to get the raw HTML. \n\n* **Metadata**: The generator then loads the metadata for a specific post - these would be things like the title, template file names, description, date, and groups. The information in the metadata would be displayed in the page's header and could also be used by the server to filter posts by groups, sort them by date, etc.\n\n* **Templates**: The generator loads and applies some base templates in the form of some HTMLs and CSS. It includes whatever additional templates are required for a specific page, such as [`groups.css`](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website/blob/main/public/templates/group.css) for group pages and [`github-fetch.md`](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website/blob/main/public/templates/github-fetch.md) for GitHub README posts.\n\n* **Write to HTML file**: Finally, the server bundles it all up and writes it to an HTML file, which can be served by the Node.js webserver.\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWriting these posts and building the infrastructure for this website have both been very time-consuming and quite the adventure, but honestly, I think I've done a pretty acceptable job, regarding the quality of both the actual content and the underlying programming. Creating and editing new posts is now an effortless process, group pages are generated automatically by the compiler, and my automated integration and deployment pipeline is working flawlessly. I've also grown quite fond of Markdown and YAML during the making of this project.\n\nI truly believe my current setup for maintaining this website is a viable solution for a personal blog-style website such as my own. And no, I don't mean it's complete by any stretch of the imagination - there's still a lot of work to do and loads of features to add. But I'm certain it has the potential to create websites which are aesthetically pleasing and minimalist in nature, yet still very functional and expandable.\n\nHopefully people can see what this system is capable of and will adapt it to their own use cases, or at least learn a thing or two from my ongoing [webdesign adventures](/webdesign).\n\nAnd it turns out that this project also helped me realize that I actually really enjoy writing! This project was a surprisingly enjoyable way to combine my programming skills with writing, and I never thought creating a personal blog could be this fun. I can totally see myself writing posts for the remainder of this year, at least.\n\nFor the time being, this is all I have to share about my website. If you've made it this far, thank you soooo much for reading this - I've put a lot of effort into making all of what you see right now. \n\nHave a good one!

This is just a quick post about why I'm removing all text justification from my website. I've included links to additional resources and reading materials from folks that are much more qualified to write about this sort of stuff than I am._\n\nOver the last couple of days, I noticed that the justified text on some of my posts can sometimes look quite jarring.\nAs an example, take a look at the following section from my [review on _Sinnohvation_](http://34.200.98.64:3000/sinnohvation).\n\n![image1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/693296031982682184/851171575847321700/unknown.png?width=830&height=632)\n\nNotice the (oftentimes huge) gaping holes between words. In particular, check out the 3rd line of the 3rd paragraph and the 2nd and 4th lines of the 4th paragraph. \n\nIt looks horrible. Atrocious. Awful. Disturbing. Ridiculous, even. Besides being unberably ugly, it makes text somewhat harder to read, and since I often invest a lot of time writing and proofreading these posts, I feel betrayed by ugly justification.\n\nIn web development/design, text justification is taken care of by  CSS (short for _Cascading Style Sheets_), a special language that goes hand in hand with HTML and whose sole purpose is to style webpages and make them prettier to the human eye. In CSS, we can specify _properties_ which essentially tell the browser how it should render/display a certain part of your webpage. \n\nTake a look at the following example CSS code snippet. Here, I'm using a set of properties (`width`, `text-align`, `overflow-x`, etc.) to style a `div` with a class of `main`.\n\n```css\n.main {\n  width: 800px;\t\n  overflow-wrap: break-word;\n  text-align: justify;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  overflow-x: auto;\n}\n```\n\nNotice the `text-align: justify;` property - basically, it's telling the broswer to take the text inside that `div` and _justify_ it, which means stretching out the words so that they touch both the left and right-most edges of the `div`, in the same way that justified text on a book is stretched to align with the left and right margins of the page.\n\nEarlier today I read [this post](https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/) on _Design For Hackers_ showing why `text-align: justify;` is so bad, and honestly, I agree with Mr. David Kadavy. In fact, after digging a little bit deeper, it appears that justified text on the web [has had a bad reputation for quite some time](https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/why-does-justified-text-have-such-a-bad-reputation-on-the-web/). Even worse, it often looks like a [rookie typography mistake](https://meetchopz.medium.com/10-bad-typography-habits-that-scream-amateur-8bac07f9c041).\n\nApparently, this is becuase of the incredibly poor text justification algorithm used by CSS/HTML, since all it does is add gaps between words to stretch a line of text to touch the edges of a `div` container, without adding hyphenation, word-splitting or any other sort of modifications to the block of text. This seems to constrat starkly with the justification process in regular print media, notably, books and newspapers. [This post](http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/book-design-basics-hyphens-justification/) by David Bricker in his _Book Design Basics_ series does a good job of explaining how to use hyphenation to justify text for books.\n\nSo, for web developers/designers such as myself, it looks like the best option as of right now is to just ditch justification all together in favor of left-aligned text. Thankfully, all I need to do is to change a single line of CSS:\n\n```css\n.main {\n  width: 800px;\t\n  overflow-wrap: break-word;\n  /* Begone, justified text! */\n  text-align: left;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  overflow-x: auto;\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's how that same section from my _Sinnohvation_ review looks like now:\n\n![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/693296031982682184/851171420952199198/unknown.png?width=858&height=631)\n\nWhile symmetrical, perfectly aligned blocks of text can look quite aesthetically pleasing in some books, they can really be an eyesore when it comes to webpages. For the time being, removing text justification seems to be a decent compromise.\n\nExpect more typography and web design posts in the next couple of weeks as I spend a little more time working on my website, including improving my webpage generator/templating system, learning responsive design, and improving readability, and adding even more ✨fancy CSS✨."},"prism-testing":{"meta":{"title":"Trying out Prism.js","templates":[],"description":"Testing **Prism.js**, a frontend library for awesome code snippets with syntax highlighting and other neat things\n","groups":["all","programming","webdesign"],"date":"2021-05-30T17:38:00.000Z"},"md":" \n\nI've just added a new library to my website, [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/), which adds syntax highlighting and overall better code snippets. \n\nSince my posts often place a heavy emphasis on coding, I figured that having quality code snippets with adequate syntax highlighting (among other things) will add a lot of value to my programming-related posts. \n\nAnd from the looks of it, Prism is working pretty well. Just to demonstrate, here are a couple of example code snippets.\n\nThe first example code snippet is a small part of the main `bot.py` file from my [RedstoneBot](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot) project, written in Python.\n\n\n```python\n# module imports\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\n# function imports from files\nfrom login import login\nfrom format_help import format_help\nfrom get_status import get_status\nfrom get_times import get_times\nfrom activate import activate\nfrom deactivate import deactivate\nfrom reactivate import reactivate\nfrom register import register\nfrom leave_queue import leave_queue\nfrom unregister import unregister\nfrom get_list import get_list\n\n# member role functions\nfrom role_functions import (\n    check_user,\n    check_admin,\n)\n\n# database functions\nfrom db_functions import (\n    link,\n    guild_in_db,\n    IP_in_db,\n    get_serverID,\n    get_looping,\n    update_looping,\n    deleteEntry,\n)\n\n# credentials\nfrom credentials import (\n    username,\n    password,\n    token,\n)\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n# Discord setup\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n# command prefix\nclient = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!redstone ')\n\n# Redstone dust reddish color for Rich Embeds\nredstoneRed = discord.Colour.from_rgb(221,55,55)\n\n# removing default Help command\nclient.remove_command('help')\n\n# bot startup\n@client.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    # retrieving aiohttp ClientSession\n    global session_list\n    session = session_list[0]\n\n    # logging in to ploudos.com\n    login_status_code = await login(username, password, session)\n    print('\\nLogin status code: ' + str(login_status_code))\n\n    print('Bot is ready to roll!\\n')\n\n\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n# Discord commands\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n# help command - shows useful help page w/ commands + other things\n@client.command()\nasync def help(ctx):\n\n    title, content = format_help()\n    # format and send rich embed\n    page=discord.Embed(\n        title=title,\n        description=content,\n        colour=redstoneRed\n    )\n    await ctx.send(embed=page)\n\n\n\n\n\n# ping command - replies with \"Pong!\" + connection latency in miliseconds\n@client.command()\nasync def ping(ctx):\n    await ctx.send(f'Pong! :ping_pong: Connection latency is {round(client.latency * 1000)}ms')\n\n```\n\nFor the second example, I'll try a code snippet in C++.

This is the user manual for RedstoneBot.\n\nThis short guide will show you how to add and setup RedstoneBot for your Discord server.\n\n_Looking for how to create a clone of RedstoneBot instead? [Take a look here.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot#usage-ubuntu-linux)_\n\n  \n\n## Step 1: Add Redstone to your Discord server\n\n[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769761270269476887&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add Redstone to your server.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/804124108861734962/unknown.png?width=1044&height=600)\n\nChoose the server you want to add Redstone to and complete the Captcha.\n\nNext, you'll need to give Redstone permission to open and close your server.  \n  \n  \n\n## Step 2: Give RedstoneBot permission to control your PloudOS server\n\nLogin to [PloudOS](https://ploudos.com) and access your server list [here](http://ploudos.com/server/).\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/804126475539709952/unknown.png?width=1385&height=600)\n\nNext, choose the server you want Redstone to control (Note: you must be the server's owner).\n\nOpen the server's management page.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/804127300865228800/unknown.png?width=1395&height=600)\n\nScroll down and click the \"Share Server\" tab on the bottom left.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/866688435397197824/unknown.png?width=410&height=641)\n\nShare your server with the user **RedstoneBot**. Give it permission to open/close your server and access the console by selecting the appropriate checkboxes, as shown below. Finally, click the \"Share\" button.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/760252264723644426/866687872093257748/unknown.png)\n\nHang on, we're almost there!  \n  \n  \n\n## Step 3: Run the _setup_ command\n\nOpen Discord on your [browser](https://discord.com/app) or desktop. Then, go to the server you just added Redstone to.\n\n_Protip: if you haven't already, you might want to create a separate channel or category just for bots and mute it. Bots are annoying, sometimes._ 😕\n\nNow, you'll need to link your Discord server to the PloudOS server you want Redstone to control.\n\nAll you need to do is run the _setup_ command and specify your server's IP address, like so:\n\n```js\n!redstone setup myverycoolserver.ploudos.me\n```\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/804130942050107402/unknown.png)\n\nIf all goes well, you'll get a confirmation message. If you entered an incorrect/invalid IP, just try again.\n\nIf you're sure you're entering a valid IP but didn't get the message in the picture above, then please make sure Redstone has permissions to manage your server, as described in step 2.\n\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Assign Roles\n\nAt this point, you should be all set if you plan on using RedstoneBot on your own. But of course, one of RedstoneBot's main features is to provide an easier UI for your friends to control your PloudOS Minecraft server, and to do this, you'll need to create and assign roles within your Discord server.\n\nRight click on your server name or icon and head to **Server Settings** and then **Roles**.\n  \n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/866690395135017010/unknown.png?width=1152&height=642)\n\nCreate a new role called **Redstone User**. No need to change the role's permissions. Users with this role can use basic commands, such as **_status_**, **_list_**, **_time_**, and start your PloudOS server with the **_start_** command.\n\nOptionally, create a new role called **Redstone Admin**. This role requires only the default permissions as well. Users with this role can use all RedstoneBot commands, including stopping the server with **_stop_**, leaving the actication queue with **_exit_**, and use configuration commands such as **_setup_** and **_reset_**.\n\n**NOTE:** Users with admin permissions already default to Redstone Admins, so no need to assign these roles to yourself or other admins within your server.\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/866691861045051452/unknown.png?width=826&height=642)\n\n## Done! Redstone is ready to roll.\n\nThat's all there is to it! To make sure RedstoneBot is working properly, use the **_status_** command, like so:\n\n```js\n!redstone status\n```\n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/804131538161369098/unknown.png?width=778&height=600)  \n\n## More Features\n\nTake a look at the [commands page](/redstone-features) or use the _help_ command to see all of Redstone's features.\n\n```js\n!redstone help\n```\n"},"redstone-readme":{"meta":{"templates":["github-fetch.md"],"groups":["github-readme"],"github-url":"https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot/","date":"2021-05-27T14:33:00.000Z"},"md":""},"redstone-shutdown":{"meta":{"title":"Shutting down RedstoneBot","templates":[],"description":"Shutdown notice for RedstoneBot.\n","groups":["redstone-posts"],"date":"2021-08-07T00:09:00.000Z"},"md":" \n\nHi internet. Lucca here.\n\nSome really weird things happened last Friday, August 6th, which some of you may have noticed, and some new information has come to light which significantly impacts RedstoneBot's future.\n\n#### TL;DR: I have decided to officially shut down RedstoneBot.\n\n* **RedstoneBot will be still be available for up to 1 week as of writing this. The official shutdown will happen no later than Saturday, August 14th.**\n*  **All development on RedstoneBot will be ceased, effective immediately, and RedstoneBot's GitHub repo will be archived soon.**\n* **Following the shutdown, RedstoneBot's database will be purged to protect its users' privacy.**\n\nFeel free to continue reading for an in-depth explanation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n## What happened?\n\nYesterday, Erik Groh, owner, lead developer and chief manager at PloudOS.com, issued a **30-day ban to RedstoneBot and all users who had given RedstoneBot access to their PloudOS server** (including myself) over alleged violations of the PloudOS.com rules.\n\nThis decision was quite shocking, as Erik and his team were already aware of the bot's existence and its active development since late January of 2021. Furthermore, at the time of the ban, **RedstoneBot and its users were not breaking any of PloudOS.com's [rules/terms of service](https://ploudos.com/rules/?force_lang=EN)**, thus making the ban an unfair decision on Erik's part.\n\nAnd for those of you who aren't aware, RedstoneBot is also Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licensed under [GNU GPL v3.0](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot/blob/main/LICENSE), meaning that anyone can inspect the bot's [source code](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot) to identify malicious activity or abusive behavior.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n## Am I still banned from PloudOS?!\n\n**No.** I have contacted Erik and he agreed to unban RedstoneBot and all of its users, so you should still be able to use PloudOS normally. If you are still banned for using RedstoneBot, please visit the [PloudOS Discord](https://discord.gg/v2dRgku) and open a ticket or send a PM to Erik at **Erik#5555**.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n## If the bot has been unbanned, then why are you still shutting it down?\n\n**TL;DR**: Due to conflicts of interest with PloudOS.\n\nWhen I contacted Erik yesterday, he stated that bots such as RedstoneBot have two major problems:\n\n1. **They can hurt PloudOS' ad revenue** (which comprises the bulk of their revenue) since RedstoneBot is a web scraper and interfaces directly with PloudOS' internal API without viewing ads.\n\n2. **Bots are not welcome at PloudOS anymore** and \"negatively impact the website\". A system to prevent bot usage will be implemented soon and the rules will be updated to reflect this.\n\nBoth of the these arguments are acceptable, to a certain extent. Personally, I still have some trouble grasping with Erik's logic, but I've chosen to not discuss this any further in this post and will ultimately accept his decision. I'm not going to tell anyone how to run their business.\n\nBut given that PloudOS is adopting anti-bot measures, this leaves RedstoneBot in a very vulnerable position. **RedstoneBot was not created to exploit or bypass any security measures**, therefore all further development on RedstoneBot will be ceased, effective immediately.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you to all of you who have used RedstoneBot through 2021 and supported its development in one way or another. This is has been a really fun project to work on, and I learned a bunch of cool stuff along the way. If any news comes up, I'll post it here. \n\nThat's all I got for now. Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions.

It was created by a German guy called Erik Groh. [Check it out!](https://ploudos.com/)\n\n### What exactly is RedstoneBot? What does it do?\n\nRedstoneBot is a Discord bot for interacting with Minecraft servers hosted by PloudOS, and was originally built for the SMP BR Discord, a small Minecraft Survival Multiplayer community based in Brasília, Brazil.\n\nIn short, RedstoneBot lets you do all (well, mostly) the same things that you would (normally) do on your server's management page at PloudOS.com, but from the comfort and coziness of your favorite Discord server. How cool is that?\n\n### How did you make this bot?\n\nAt the heart of RedstoneBot is Python 3 and the discord.py API wrapper for Discord.\n\nHere are some of the modules I used. Some of them already come pre-installed with Python.\n\n**AsyncIO** - Used to write concurrent (i.e. \"asynchronously executed\") code/frameworks\n\n**AIOHTTP** - Asynchronous HTTP requests, built on top of AsyncIO\n\n**JSON** - Decodes and encodes JSON objects\n\n**CSV** - Read/write operations for Comma Separated Value (CSV) files \n\n**Beautiful Soup** - HTML Parsing and web scraping\n\nI spent a fair amount of time experimenting with some other modules, too, but these ones sacrificed a lot of performance for simplicity. If RedstoneBot has any chance of scaling up, it can't (and shouldn't) rely on these modules for dealing with multiple Discord servers and dozens of API calls per second.\n\n**Selenium webdriver for Python** - Web browser automation; a cool way to automate boring web-based tasks, but really, really, really slow. It can't handle dynamic web pages well. From my experince, Selenium is still super finicky and very hit or miss.\n\n**Requests**, a.k.a. \"HTTP for humans\" -  a really awesome library for foolproof HTTP requests/responses, and it comes with lots of neat tools, like custom headers, cookies, persistent sessions, and more. Unfortunately, it doesn't have support for AsyncIO, which can make web apps take a performance hit, especially when you're dealing with things such as API calls.\n\nRedstoneBot is currently hosted on an AWS Lightsail instance running Ubuntu 20.04.\n\nFor more technical details, check out the repo linked above the N.S.F.A.Q.'s.\n\n### Why did you spend your time making this?\n\nBecause I like challenges and I code to learn.\n\nFirst and foremost, building RedstoneBot was a programming adventure. I knew basically nothing about web scraping techniques before starting this journey. But I've learned things which I would never have learned if it weren't for this project: AsyncIO and asynchronous programming, event loops, how to properly read technical software documentation, HTTP requests and responses, decoding/encoding JSON data, creating and interacting with simple CSV databases, and tons more. All of these new skills will most certainly help me with more complex software projects in the future.\n\nBut, of course, building a cool bot to impress your Discord buddies isn't too shabby, either. 😉\n\n### What's the next step in the development of RedstoneBot?\n\nNext step...? It's done. I need to get a life now.\n\nI'll make some commits to the GitHub repo here and there, but they'll be few and far between."},"sinnohvation":{"meta":{"title":"Album review: _Sinnohvation_","templates":[],"description":"An in-depth analysis of _Sinnohvation_, the late 2020 mega-release from composer, arranger, YouTuber and multi-instrumentalist Carlos Eiene.\n","album-embed":"<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0vbD4L4GvVkxrfwdN6iL5e\" width=100% height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> \n","groups":[],"date":"2021-05-27T17:30:00.000Z"},"md":"   \n\n\n_**Note**: this review is a work-in-progress!_\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0vbD4L4GvVkxrfwdN6iL5e\" width=100% height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\n> Table of contents\n> - [Introduction](#introduction)    \n> - [The Album](#the-album)    \n>   - [Opening](#opening)    \n>   - [The Journey Begins](#the-journey-begins)    \n> - [Where to Buy](#where-to-buy)     \n> - [Verdict](#verdict)   \n\n## Introduction\n\nThe YouTube-based VGM (videogame music) cover scene has grown a lot over the last couple of years. While you might think that it's still a tiny space in the huge world of music productions on the video streaming platform, chances are, you've probably encountered one of the many up and coming VGM artists, especially if you watch anything gaming-related on YouTube.\n\nAs more and more people (especially  teenagers and young adults) get into the increasingly accessible world of gaming, fueled by the release of novel gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the ever-growing quality of both big-budget and indie game titles, the demand for videogame soundtracks and covers will follow. As such, a new niche in the vast realm of in the internet was formed: the world of VGM covers, populated by amateur and professional musicians alike, who record their own renditions of tunes from the games they love and share them with a passionate community of gamers and music fans.\n\nSome of the YouTube's most notable VGM cover artists include a capella singer Max \"Smooth McGroove\" Gleason, drummer/Twitch streamer Jerod \"The8BitDrummer\" Collins, singer/songwriter Adriana \"Adrisaurus\" Figueroa, metal-rock guitarrist Jules \"FamilyJules\" Conroy, funk bassist Alex Moukala, and composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist director Charlie Rosen, the director of the NYC-based ensemble _The 8-Bit Big Band_.\n\nOut of the bunch, though, one particular musician stands out from the crowd for his unique background and approach to VGM performance and arrangement. Carlos Eiene (a.k.a insaneintherainmusic), a YouTuber/composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist who graduated from the Berkelee College of Music in 2020, has become a staple of the VGM community for his unique jazz-inspired remixes of famous tunes from _Undertale_, _The Legend of Zelda_ series, _Super Mario_, _Persona 5_, and _Pokémon_ games.\n\nAccording to Carlos himself, the soundtrack from the fourth generation of Pokémon games has had a profund impact on his musical development, being the very reason he got into Jazz music in the first place. So, as his main endeavor for his final year at Berklee, Carlos was determined to put his energy into making the best musical tribute he could to a game which has been extremeley influential to him as a person and as a musician.\n\nAnd so, in this edition of Album Review, I'd like to spend some time to talk about insaneintherainmusic's magnum opus of sorts - _Sinnohvation_, a tribute album to the soundtrack of _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_.\n\n<!-- ## Who is insaneintherainmusic?\n\nCarlos Eiene is an American-Filipino composer, multi-instrumentalist and arranger from Seattle. He started recording his first jazz remixes of VGM tunes while he was still in high school. \n\nHe is one of the few big names in the VGM scene with a background in Jazz. He studied Contemporary Composition and Jazz Performance at the Berkelee College of Music in Boston.  -->\n\n---\n\n## The Album\n\n_Sinnohvation_ is comprised of mostly jazz-inspired arrangements of tracks from the _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_ games. It's a  really, _**really**_ long album clocking in at 3 hours and 50 minutes of music. The tracks vary widly in length, with some lasting only 2 or 3 minutes, while most fall into the 4 to 6 minute category (an appropriate length for a colletion of jazz tunes), and some more ambitious tracks even dip into the 7 minute territory. \n\nThe original soundtrack for _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_ was composed by GAME FREAK sound team members Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, Hitomi Sato and Morikazu Aoki, who all have a history of composing and producing songs for Pokémon games on the GBA, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.\n\n<!-- It's arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a \"insaneintherainmusic\".\n\nThis album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.\n\nThe sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music. -->\n\n\n### Opening\n\nThe album starts off with [_Opening Movie_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJw6JAkkBTY&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=1), a recreation of the song that accompanies _Pokémon D/P/Pt_'s opening sequence. Arrangement-wise, it's a pretty faithful recreation at that, but what's impressive about this track is the tone it sets for the rest of the album. \n\nFrom the get-go, the listener is greeted with a twenty-piece student orchestra with strings, harp, grand piano, and bombastic brass. _Sinnohvation_ is, first and foremost, a (mostly )live-recorded studio album with a diverse set of passionate student musicians led by Carlos Eiene. The extensive use of human musicians as opposed to software/virtual instruments was a deliberate choice by Carlos, who once stated that \n\n> _\"Not even the greatest MIDI [sound] library can come even close to a good performer. [It] doesn't quite replace the interaction you get between musicians in a room or a musician who spent hours and hours practicing a single note. That is something I really believe in - the power of live instruments\"_.\n\nAfter that, we have [_Sinnohvation_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG1sTfsXnuI&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=2), the namesake of the album. Long-time insaneintherainmusic fans might recognize this track as a re-arrangement/re-recording of the [_Professor Rowan's Lab_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PrCE_Vy0E) cover in the form of a recreation of the _Opening Sequence_ track from _D/P/Pt_'s OST. \n\nCarlos's single vocal verse in this track,\n\n> _Welcome to Sinnoh, everybody! Here we go!_\n\nfollowed by the energetic piano/string/sax/flute jam, is an invitation to the listener, who's about to embark in a 50-track, 3 hour and 50 minute-long journey across the musical landscape of Pokémon Gen. 4. \n\nSo if you're really commited to follow along with this musical quest, take an afternoon off, grab a seat and a pair of headphones, because this album takes the listener on a unique, interesting and often times charming adventure.\n\n### The Journey Begins\n\nThe next couple of tracks, namely, _Twinleaf Town_ and _Route 201_, instantly remind you about the \"Pokémon-iness\" of this music collection. This is the beginning of your Pokémon-catching, Team Galactic-squashing, Gym Leader-battling adventure across the Sinnoh region, and there's no better way to start it than with the iconic home town theme and the first route theme.\n\n[_Twinleaf Town_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlm8kIulpo&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=3) revolves around a cool and minimalist groove with a clean electric guitar, electric bass, drums and tenor sax, and slowly gets more energetic as the flutes and piano join the mix. Carlos' solo on the tenor sax clearly borrows tone and improvisation ideas from infamous jazz-fusion saxophonist Michael Brecker of the _The Brecker Brothers_. This tune is \n\nOn [_Route 201_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD5sJO0Y7Nk&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=4), the listener is instroduced to a fairly esoteric synthesizer-like instrument - the [_EWI_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)) (Electronic Wind Instrument), a woodwind-shaped MIDI controller, also made famous by Michael Brecker. Carlos' ability to take the simplistic melody of the original _Route 201_ theme and bring it to life with a rich instrumentation, unique reharmonization and jazz-fusion-like sound is immediately noticable. \n\nThe following track, [_Lake Verity_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXajUkHjghk&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=5), features jazz percussionist Doug Perry on vibraphone. It's a more traditional jazz tune, with a song structure and instrumentation which clearly takes inspiration from the hard bop era. The alto/tenor/baritone saxophone solis, although simple at times, are a joy to listen to. In the head of the tune, the playful call and response between saxophones and the electric jazz guitar/vibes duo is a small touch, but it's wonderfully well executed. The song as a whole is has a distinctly chill atmosphere which slowly builds energy and releases it all at once in the final sax soli.\n\n\n\n## Where to Buy\n\n_Sinnovation_ is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube/YouTube Music, Pandora, Deezer and Amazon Music.\n\nAdditionally, you can purchase the digital download in high-quality MP3 and FLAC on iTunes, Bandcamp and Amazon.\n\nThe album is also available as a 12\" vinyl featuring the Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble tracks and as a 3-disc CD pack, both of which can be purchased on Bandcamp, though these are usually manufactured in small batches and are often sold out. Signed copies were available for some time in the latter part of 2020, but are already sold out.\n\n\n## Verdict\n\nOverall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and Pokémon fans alike. \n\nA solid **9/10**.\n\n\n\n"},"tank-battle":{"meta":{"title":"Tank Battle!","templates":["github-fetch.md"],"groups":["github-readme"],"github-url":"https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Tank-Battle/","date":"2021-05-27T14:36:00.000Z"},"md":" "},"tech-picks-07-21":{"meta":{"title":"Monthly Tech Picks - July/21","templates":[],"groups":["all","monthly-tech-picks"],"description":"Taking an in-depth look at the best hardware and technology projects and products that I've come across in July of 2021.\n","img-preview":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/871863472042967120/unknown.png?width=1165&height=655\n","date":"2021-08-19T16:43:00.000Z"},"md":" \n\nHello world, and welcome to Monthly Tech Picks!

Enjoy!\n\n---\n\n## Framework Laptop\n\nIf you've been following any tech news at all lately, then chances are you've heard about the Framework Laptop.\n\nFramework, a hardware startup from Burlingame, California, has been making headlines recently for the long-antipicated release of the Framework Laptop, a one-of-a-kind laptop that prioritizes users' freedom to dissassemble, repair, customize and upgrade their machine as they see fit.\n\n> Our philosophy is that by making well-considered design tradeoffs and trusting customers and repair shops with the access and information they need, we can make fantastic devices that are still easy to repair. Even better, what we’ve done to enable repair also opens up upgradeability and customization. This lets you get exactly the product you need and extends usable lifetime too.  <p style=\"opacity: 0.5\">_- [About page](https://frame.work/about), Framework Computer Inc._</p>\n\n![img](https://images.prismic.io/frameworkmarketplace/5d87bd50-8e78-4a7a-ade9-4356e3693416_Pre-Marketplace+-+image_02.jpg?auto=compress,format)\n\nFramework promises to manufacture and ship portable machines with unmatched repairability and upgradeability without compromising design, weight or performance. And so far, they've managed to deliver: the Framework Laptop has proven to be a performant and dependable machine, capable of taking near full advantage of the latest generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and managing to stay on par with similarly spec'd laptops.\n\nOne thing remains to be seen, however - the future availability of mainboard upgrade options. Framework has promised to manufacture new mainboards regularly with new Intel chipset options as they become available, claiming that users will be able to purchase a replacement board with a more powerful CPU (and maybe even dedicated GPUs) down the line, should they wish to upgrade their machines. Only time will tell if they will be able to meet their claims.\n\nPromises aside, though, I think it's fair to say that Framework has succeded in building a very unique and promising laptop.\n\n### Machine Specs\n\n* **CPU** - 11th generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 or i7-1185G7 (both are quad-core models)\n* **GPU** - Intel Iris XE G7 Graphics (integrated)\n* **Memory** - up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM by Crucial\n* **Storage** - up to 4TB of WD Black NVMe SSD storage by Western Digital\n* **Display** - 13.5\", 2256 x 1504 IPS monitor by BOE\n* **Wireless** - Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 (optional vPro model available)\n* **Battery** - 55 Wh Lithium-Ion battery\n* **Charger** - 60 Watt USB-C Power Delivery power supply (optional) \n* **OS** - Windows 10 Home, Pro or bring your own\n\n\n\n### Reviews\n\nIf you want to check out a more detailed and in-depth review of this machine, then I highly suggest that you check out [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Framework-Laptop-13-5-Review-If-Microsoft-Made-A-Repairable-Surface-Laptop-This-Would-Be-It.551850.0.html)'s review. In my opinion, they're by far the most thorough tech reviewers on the Internet. I can't recommend them enough. \n\nOf course, also you might also be interested in checking out [Linus Tech Tips' great review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rkTgPt3M4k) on YouTube.\n\n### Where to Buy\n\nThe Framework Laptop is available for pre-order on [Framework's offical website](https://frame.work/), starting at $999 for a prebuilt model, or $749 if you choose the DIY edition, which comes with tons of options for configuring your machine. As of writing this, the next batch of laptops will be shipping in September 2021. You'll also need to pay a refundable $100 deposit to secure your pre-order.\n\n### But wait, there's more!\n\nIt's definitely worth noting that the Framework Laptop's Expansion Cards are open-source (!), meaning that you can freely design your own hardware to make your laptop even more capable and flexible. Check out the official GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionCards).\n\n\n---\n\n## DevTerm\n\nLook, it's a retro-futuristic cyberdeck! No, it's a Tandy TRS-80! It's... neither, and both at the same time...?\n\nMeet the [DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm) by Clockwork Pi. It's an [open hardware](https://github.com/clockworkpi/DevTerm) ARM-powered portable computer that looks like it came straight out of a Radio Shack catalog from 1980's. The official website describes it as a \"portable terminal for every dev\", but it's actually a fully-fledged computer perfectly capable of running Debian-based Linux distros, such as Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu and Clockwork's own flavor of Linux, clockworkOS (which apparently is still in development).\n\nThe DevTerm clearly takes a lot of inspiration from old-school portables from the 80's and early 90's like the NEC PC-8200 and the infamous Tandy TRS-80 Model 100. Folks craving some nostalgic retrocomputing vibes will definitely find a lot to love with this device - the DevTerm really manages to capture the core aesthetics of machines from the past while still maintaining a clean and very fascinating design.\n\nLike any good 21st century computing machine should, the DevTerm can run development tools for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including C/C++, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Lua, Rust, Go, Processing, Arduino, and, of course, good ol' Basic and Lisp. You should also be able to run some basic gaming software, including fantasy consoles like PICO-8 and TIC-80 and retro emulators like RetroArch.\n\n<!-- ![img](http://34.200.98.64/images/devterm.png) -->\n\n![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/871947604311801867/E6U7b3DVIAcvpbI.png?width=830&height=650)\n\n### Hardware\n\nPersonally, I think the hardware is where the DevTerm shines the most. The external shell comes disassembled and it's made to be put together like some sort of Gundam/Gunpla mecha kit, by snapping off the individual components and building the device piece by piece with the included [assembly manual](https://github.com/clockworkpi/DevTerm/raw/main/Clockwork_DevTerm_Assembly_Guidelines.pdf). \n\nFor input, you've got a (very!) tiny QWERTY keyboard, a really small trackball and a gamepad with D-pad and ABXY buttons. From what I've seen, the keyboard is just large enough to [barely fit your hands on the home row](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/436242411975606274/877631512172961812/image1.jpg?width=886&height=665) but small emough to [make handheld gaming and thumb typing possible](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/436242411975606274/877631511715786762/image0.jpg?width=498&height=664). (Image credits: **ksbex#7267** on Discord)\n\nClockworkPi's not-a-retrocomputer can be powered either by a [Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+ Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-plus/) or a range of pinout-compatible System-on-Modules developed by ClockworkPi, nicknamed [\"Cores\"](https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm#bgLayers_comp-khfqg1tp). They use ARM-based CPUs (Rockchip RK3399 or Allwinner H6) with varying amounts of processing/graphical power and RAM (up to 4GB LPDDR3).\n\nAs for the rest, the device comes with an \"ultrawide\" 6.8-inch 16:6 display - the wide aspect ratio (which apparently is exactly 2xVGA) is kind of wonky, but might work well enough with most software and some games. The DevTerm's mainboard also has a wireless module with support for WiFi and Bluetooth 5. The machine is powered by two Li-Ion 18650 cells (not included due to shipping restrictions) and has built-in power management circuitry for charging over USB-C.\n\nThere's also a good number of ports on the mini-computer, including USB-C with charging, Micro HDMI, an SD card reader (which is where the device boots from), a headphone jack (it comes with stereo speakers too) and three USB-As. Oh, and it comes with a thermal printer (!) which can be attached to an expansion port.\n\n\n![img](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/clockworkpi/original/2X/a/af3ae857baeb2ae887ce44772e4f910fef3c4fcd.jpeg)\n\n### Who the heck is ClockWorkPi?\n\nIf you've been paying attention to the retro handheld scene for the last couple of years, then you might have heard of the [GameShell](https://www.clockworkpi.com/gameshell), an [open-source](https://github.com/clockworkpi/GameShellDocs) portable game console that first popped into the retro gaming community over 2 years ago. That thing as also made by ClockworkPi! \n\nCuriously though, I wasn't able to find a whole lot about the company - I've spent quite some time searching the web for official information about them, but honestly, I'm still not 100% sure. After doing some digging, it appears ClockworkPi is based somewhere in China, possibly in Guangzhou, with some of their team members working in Europe or maybe North America. They certainly manufacture their hardware in China, though, as mentioned in this [post](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/devterm-production-status-update/6413/317) by one of their team members.\n\n### Preorder status\n\nAt the time of writing this, [Clockwork Pi's official online storefront](https://www.clockworkpi.com/shop) is temporarily closed as the team is working to get the first batches of DevTerms out to the folks who pre-ordered the device earlier this year. After checking the [ClockworkPi forums](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/devterm-production-status-update/6413/391) today, it appears that some people are already receiving their DevTerms in the mail. \n\n**Aug. 29th Update** - one of the CPi's forum and Discord moderators, who goes by the handle _Godzil_, has posted an unboxing and assembly video of their very own DevTerm, which can be viewed [viewed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgtxEx7YT1M&t=1184s).\n\nOnce the shop reopens, though, you should be able to purchase a DevTerm from anywhere between **$219 USD** for the base RPi CM3 version and **$319 USD** for the Rockchip RK3399 model. Pricey indeed.\n\n---\n\n## WiFiWart \n\n<!-- [Part 0](https://machinehum.medium.com/im-putting-a-wifi-router-into-a-wall-charger-part-0-2c1e1a80ccde) -->\n\n\nThis device has got to be _the most_ L33T H4X0R of DIY projects that I've ever seen, bar none. Meet the WiFiWart by Ryan Walker - it's your standard, run-of-the-mill wall wart charger that just so happens to hide a fully-fledged Linux single board computer with wireless networking. \n\nIts purpose? To do all sorts of ~nasty network exploits~ important penetration testing and security research work, including sniffing local connections, launching man-in-middle attacks, password sniffing, and much more, all while looking like an innocent little phone charger that someone just probably forgot. \n\nOh, and did I mention that it's all [open-source hardware and software](https://github.com/Machine-Hum/wifiwart)?\n\n\n> Drop one of these in a McDonald's, and nobody’s going to expect a thing. You can leave it for days, while it collects data and marshals it back to your home network. <p style=\"opacity: 0.5\">_- Ryan Walker, owner of Interrupt Labs_</p>\n\n![img](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/872341313679396874/unknown.png?width=741&height=656)\n\nIt's a scary device, for sure, but in a good way, I guess. What I like so much about this tiny computer is that it showcases just how far you can get by using hobbyist tools for electronics design and manufacturing. The fact that someone can build a powerful Linux-capable single board computer nowadays from their home, using open source CAD software is, honestly, just mind-blowing.\n\n## Hardware\n\nThere's a lot of really interesting hardware being used in this tiny machine, some of which is hilariously overpowered. At the heart of the WiFiWart, you'll find an Allwinner A33 SoC with a quad-core 1.2Ghz ARM A7 CPU, a Mali400MP2 GPU and tons of peripheral interfaces. There's also a DDR3 memory chip with 1GB of RAM (why so much ram r u ok), some fairly complex power regulation circuitry to power the whole system, and USB ports to interface with the Realtek wireless modules.\n\nThe PCBs were designed with KiCad and the mechanical parts were designed with FreeCad. All sources are available [here](https://github.com/Machine-Hum/wifiwart).\n\n![img](https://github.com/Machine-Hum/wifiwart/raw/master/media/board.jpg)\n\n### A promising WIP project!\n\nAs of writing this, the WiFiWart is still a work-in-progress. The creator has a [Medium page](https://machinehum.medium.com/) where he shares a lot of details behind the design and testing process. They're a must read if you're looking to learn how to design hardware for embedded Linux machines, and personally, I've really enjoyed reading them. I'll definetely be taking some notes from Ryan's work for when I start learning some PCB and electronics hardware design myself.\n\nFor more updates, you can also check out the project's [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/179970-wifi-wart) page and join the [Open Source Security Hardware (OSSH) Discord](https://discord.gg/y2QJNWZpHm) for the lastest news on the WiFiWart.\n\n---\n\n## Playdate\n\nA novelty handheld game console. It's cute. It's pretty tiny as far as handhelds go. It's yellow, like, REALLY yellow. And it's got a spinny crank thingy to the side. What more could you want?\n\nThe [Playdate](https://play.date/) by [Panic](https://panic.com/) has been making the rounds over the last couple of months. Notably, pre-orders for this quirky device [sold out really freaking quick](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchwallace/2021/07/31/pre-orders-for-quirky-playdate-handheld-have-sold-out-sort-of/?sh=2091f67b4e70). And people can't seem to get enough of its retro-inspired aesthetics and intriguing design, courtesy of the talented swedes over at [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/).\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this tiny gaming machine are the seasonal game launches. Essentially, over the course of twelve weeks, users will be surprisesd two new titles every week, which will be automatically be downloaded to Playdate over Wi-Fi. Some of the games will be produced at Panic (who might know a thing or to about [making some cool games](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Panic)), but the system is relying heavily on indie developers to propel the Playdate into a broader audience.  \n\nFollowing the official release of the Playdate, Panic will be releasing a free SDK (software development kit) for making games with APIs in C and Lua. The SDK will run on Mac, Windows and Linux machines and should come with ample reference documentation as well as a Playdate simulator.\n\n\n![img](http://34.200.98.64/images/playdate.png)\n\n### Where to buy\n\nYou preorder the Playdate [here](https://shop.play.date/) for an exorbitant **$179 USD**, with an additional **$29 USD** for a purple magnetic case. Ouch.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNot a bad selection, eh? Certinaly lots of new and interesting technology here.\n\nThat's all I have for now.
