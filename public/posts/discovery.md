Arguably the best album ever made by Daft Punk. I keep arguing with myself all the freaking time on which album is better, _Discovery_ or _RAM_.

I still plan on writing a full review for this album, but for the time being, just drop whatever you're doing right and go give this LP a listen. You can thank me later. Even 20 years after _Discovery's_ release, all 14 of the album's groovy, emotional, and energetic electro-disco-funk tracks have definitely aged like fine wine. 

Long live the masters of French house.

A solid **9 out of a 10**.
