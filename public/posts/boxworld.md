# The Box World

A simple online lounge for hanging out with friends, where you play as a tiny colorful box. It even has a chat! 

This project was made solely for educational purposes. 

Have any ideas or suggestions? Check out the discussion page [here](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/The-Box-World/discussions).

This project was partly inspired by Eduardo's [Websockets chat app](https://github.com/qrno/websockets-chat) and [Websockets lounge](https://github.com/qrno/django-websockets).

## At a glimpe

This is my first full-stack JavaScript web application! ðŸ˜„ 

* **Backend** - Two Node.js servers:
  * One for serving static files (HTMLs, client-side JS scripts and CSS stylesheets)
  * Another one for handling real-time communication over Websockets and room state

  Libraries used: [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for static file server, [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) for websockets server and [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) for daemonizing server scripts

* **Frontend**
  * Minimal HTML for the home page (no styling yet) - just a simple POST request form with the user's name and room name.
  * Room page uses CSS with Flexbox for styling and a client-side script with a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) canvas for graphics and a websocket client

## Websockets message exchange model

### Server -> Client

* Message type `set-id`

  ```js
  {
    type: "set-id",
    id: "372dd9b624af"
  } 
  ```

  Sent to client on every new connection. Specficies a unique hexadecimal ID that the client uses to identify itself when exchanging other messages with the server.

* Message type `set-room`
  ```js
  {
    type: "set-room",
    room-state: 
    {
      "372dd9b624af": {
        id: "372dd9b624af",
        name: "Lucca",
        color: "#0B7A75",
        x: 258,
        y: 225,
      },
      "5b6fd779e7ee": {
        id: "5b6fd779e7ee",
        name: "qrno",
        color: "#F18F01",
        x: 525,
        y: 367,
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Sent to a client that has just logged in. This message displays the room state prior to the client"s login. 
  
  The client parses out this JSON to set the initial players positions on the p5.js canvas. 

* Message type `new player`
  ```js
  {
    type: "new-player",
    id: "f6759586f1a3",
    name: "Tyuk3",
    color: "#729B79",
    x: 522,
    y: 42,  
  }
  ```

  Sent to all active players in the room. States that a new player has been added to the room.
  
  All clients add the new player to the local player list and the p5.js canvas.

* Message type `room-update`
  ```js
  {
    type: "room-update",
    room-state: 
    {
      "372dd9b624af": {
        id: "372dd9b624af",
        name: "Lucca",
        color: "#0B7A75",
        x: 258,
        y: 225,
      },
      "5b6fd779e7ee": {
        id: "5b6fd779e7ee",
        name: "qrno",
        color: "#F18F01",
        x: 525,
        y: 367,
      },
      "965706c2062e": {
        id: "965706c2062e",
        name: "Vilsu",
        color: "#59D2FE",
        x: 266,
        y: 349,
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Sent regularly to all active players in all rooms. Represents the current positions for all active players in the room.

  The clients use this data to update the player's position on the p5.js canvas.

* Message type `down-chat`
  ```js
  {
    type: "down-chat",
    id: "372dd9b624af",
    name: "Lucca",
    message: "Hi guys!ðŸ˜„"
  }
  ```

  Sent to all active players in the room when a new chat message is received by the server. The server simply rebroadcasts the new chat message to all clients and doesn't store any information about it. 
  
  The clients parse out this JSON, display a bubble above the corresponging player and add it to the chat.

* Message type `delete-player`
  ```js
  {
    type: "delete-player",
    id: "5b6fd779e7ee",
    name: "qrno"
  }
  ```

  Sent to all players in the room when a client closes its websocket connection and, therefore, has left the room. 

  The clients use this to display an alert on the chat to remove the player from their local player list.



### Client -> Server

* Message type `login`
  ```js
  {
    type: "login",
    id: "372dd9b624af",
    name: "Lucca",
    color: "#0B7A75",
    x: 258,
    y: 225,
    room: "room1"
  }
  ```

  Sent to the server right after the client has received its unique hex ID. 

  The server uses this data to create a room with the specified name, if it doesn't already exist. If it does, it updates the room state.
  
  The server rebroadcasts this data to all players in the same room in the form of a `new-player` message.

* Message type `move`

  ```js
  {
    type: "move",
    id: "372dd9b624af",
    name: "Lucca",
    color: "#0B7A75",
    keys: "wasd",
    room: "room1"
  }
  ```

  Sent to the server when the user presses the arrow keys.

  The server parses this JSON and updates the room state accordingly.

* Message type `up-chat`
  ```js
  {
    type: "up-chat",
    id: "372dd9b624af",
    name: "Lucca",
    message: "Hi guys!ðŸ˜„",
    room: "room1"
  }
  ```

  Sent to the server when the user sends a new chat message.

  The server rebroadcasts this message to all active players in the room in the form of a `down-chat` message.

## Progress

As you can see, a fair amount of progress has been made with this project.

* Functional multiplayer

* Room page now uses Flexbox-based styling
* Added simpler (and more efficient/more effective!) player timeout and remove functions
