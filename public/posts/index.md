# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Lucca! Welcome to my personal website. 

Here you'll find lots of programming, music, electronics and life things. Check the sidebar to the left (or use the navbar above if you're on mobile) for essays, posts, project write-ups, and more.

Not sure where to start? Then consider reading [this post](/making-the-website) on how I built this website from scratch. You can also check all of my posts [here](/all). If you want to know more about myself, check this post [here](/profile).

You're more than welcome to reach out to me on Discord. Shoot a friend request over to **Lucca#2744**.
