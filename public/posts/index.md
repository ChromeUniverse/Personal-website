# Welcome to my webpage!
-------------

Hi, I'm Lucca and this is my personal webpage.

Here you'll find lots of programming, music, electronics and life shenanigans.

Check the sidebar to the left for essays, posts, project write-ups, interesting/relevant links and more.

Wanna see how this website was built? [Check out the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/personal-website)
