# Welcome!

**Hi, I'm Lucca!** Welcome to my corner of the Internet.

Here you'll find essays on science, technology, coding, electronics, music and life in general. Use the navbar above to browse my posts, project write-ups, album reviews and more.

## Not sure where to start? 

Consider reading [this post](/making-the-website) on how I built this website from scratch. 

You can also view a list of all of my posts [here](/all). 

If you would like to know more about myself, feel free to check this post [here](/me).

## Get in touch!

You're more than welcome to reach out to me on Discord - just send a friend request to *Lucca hash two seven four four*. Promise not to spam me?

Enjoy. ðŸ˜‰
