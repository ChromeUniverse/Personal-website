Welcome! This is the user manual for RedstoneBot.

This short guide will show you how to add and setup RedstoneBot for your Discord server.

_Looking for how to create a clone of RedstoneBot instead? [Take a look here.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot#usage-ubuntu-linux)_

  

## Step 1: Add Redstone to your Discord server

[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769761270269476887&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add Redstone to your server.

Choose the server you want to add Redstone to and complete the Captcha.

Next, you'll need to give Redstone permission to open and close your server.  
  
  

## Step 2: Give RedstoneBot permission to control your PloudOS server

Login to [PloudOS](https://ploudos.com) and access your server list [here](http://ploudos.com/server/).

Next, choose the server you want Redstone to control (Note: you must be the server's owner).

Open the server's management page.

Scroll down and click the "Share Server" tab on the bottom left.

Share your server with the user **RedstoneBot**. Give it permission to open and close your server by selecting the checkboxes. Then, click the "Share" button.

Hang on, we're almost there!  
  
  

## Step 3: Run the _setup_ command

Open Discord on your [browser](https://discord.com/app) or desktop. Then, go to the server you just added Redstone to.

_Protip: if you haven't already, you might want to create a separate channel or category just for bots and mute it. Bots are annoying, sometimes._ ðŸ˜•

Now, you'll need to link your Discord server to the PloudOS server you want Redstone to control.

All you need to do is run the _setup_ command and specify your server's IP address, like so:

```js
!redstone setup myverycoolserver.ploudos.me
```

If all goes well, you'll get a confirmation message. If you entered an incorrect/invalid IP, just try again.

If you're sure you're entering a valid IP but didn't get the message in the picture above, then please make sure Redstone has permissions to manage your server, as described in step 2.

  

## Done! Redstone is ready to roll.

That's all there is to it! To make sure Redstone works, use the _status_ command, like so:

`!redstone status`
