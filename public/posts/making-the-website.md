**_Note_**: work-in-progress.

This is how I made my website.

Step 1: get gud at Javascript

Step 2: write server code in Node.js

Step 3: make a really good and easy to use templating system with markdown files and Yaml metadata that can be extended with HTML and CSS whenever I need it to 

Step 4: add the ability to filter posts by groups (just make sure to never name a post with the same name as a group)

Step 5: add the ability to sort posts by decreasing timestamps when filtering by posts. (In the making!)

More to come...

Stay tuned! ðŸ˜‰
