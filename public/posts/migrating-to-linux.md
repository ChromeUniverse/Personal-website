Some 3-ish weeks I ago I finally decided to make the jump to Ubuntu Linux. It's a decision that's been brewing in my head for a very, very long time, thanks in no small part to a good friend of mine, Eduardo Quirino. 

Eduardo has been using Linux for well over 4 years now and has experimented with a slew of different Linux distros, including Ubuntu, Elementary, Xubuntu and Arch.

I can't remember the first time I actually considered switching to Linux.
