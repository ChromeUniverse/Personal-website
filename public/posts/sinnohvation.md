# My thoughts on insaneintherainmusic's _Sinnohvation_
---

_Sinnohvation_ is a jazz-fusion videogame music cover album, and is arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a "insaneintherainmusic".

This album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.

The sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music.

Overall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and Pokémon fans alike. 

A solid **9/10**.
