_**Note**: this review is a work-in-progress!_

## Preface

The YouTube-based VGM (videogame music) cover scene has grown a lot over the last couple of years. While you might think that it's still a tiny space in the huge world of music productions on the video streaming platform, chances are, you've probably encountered one of the many up and coming VGM artists, especially if you watch anything gaming-related on YouTube.

As more and more people (especially  teenagers and young adults) get into the increasingly accessible world of gaming, fueled by the release of novel gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the ever-growing quality of both big-budget and indie game titles, the demand for videogame soundtracks and covers will follow. As such, a new niche in the vast realm of in the internet was formed: the world of VGM covers, populated by amateur and professional musicians alike, who record their own renditions of tunes from the games they love and share them with a passionate community of gamers and music fans.

Some of the YouTube's most notable VGM cover artists include a capella singer Max "Smooth McGroove" Gleason, drummer/Twitch streamer Jerod "The8BitDrummer" Collins, singer/songwriter Adriana "Adrisaurus" Figueroa, metal-rock guitarrist Jules "FamilyJules" Conroy, funk bassist Alex Moukala, and composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist director Charlie Rosen, the director of the NYC-based ensemble _The 8-Bit Big Band_.

Out of the bunch, though, one particular musician stands out from the crowd for his unique background and approach to VGM performance and arrangement. Carlos Eiene (a.k.a insaneintherainmusic), a YouTuber/composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist who graduated from the Berkelee College of Music in 2020, has become a staple of the VGM community for his unique jazz-inspired remixes of famous tunes from _Undertale_, _Lengend of Zeda_, _Super Mario_, _Persona 5_, and _Pokémon_.

According to Carlos himself, the soundtrack from the fourth generation of Pokémon games has had a profund impact on his musical development, being the very reason he got into Jazz music in the first place. As such, as his main endeavor for his final year at Berklee, Carlos was determined to put his energy into making the best musical tribute he could to a game which has been extremeley influential to him as a person and as a musician.

And so, in this edition of Album Review, I'd like to spend some time to talk about insaneintherainmusic's magnum opus of sorts - _Sinnohvation_, a 50-track tribute album to the soundtrack of _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_.

## Who is insaneintherainmusic?

Carlos Eiene is an American-Filipino composer, multi-instrumentalist and arranger from Seattle. He started recording his first jazz remixes of VGM tunes while he was still in high school. 

He is one of the few big names in the VGM scene with a background in Jazz. He studied Contemporary Composition and Jazz Performance at the Berkelee College of Music in Boston. 

## The Album

_Sinnohvation_ is best decribed as a jazz-focused VGM cover album, even if the music doesn't 

It's arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a "insaneintherainmusic".

This album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.

The sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music.

The album


## Verdict

Overall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and Pokémon fans alike. 

A solid **9/10**.
