## Introduction

The YouTube-based VGM (videogame music) cover scene has grown a lot over the last couple of years. While you might think that it's still a tiny space in the huge world of music productions on the video streaming platform, chances are, you've probably encountered one of the many up and coming VGM artists, especially if you watch anything gaming-related on YouTube.

As more and more people (especially  teenagers and young adults) get into the increasingly accessible world of gaming, fueled by the release of novel gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the ever-growing quality of both big-budget and indie game titles, the demand for videogame soundtracks and covers will follow. As such, a new niche in the vast realm of in the internet was formed: the world of VGM covers, populated by amateur and professional musicians alike, who record their own renditions of tunes from the games they love and share them with a passionate community of gamers and music fans.

Some of the YouTube's most notable VGM cover artists include a capella singer Max "Smooth McGroove" Gleason, drummer/Twitch streamer Jerod "The8BitDrummer" Collins, singer/songwriter Adriana "Adrisaurus" Figueroa, metal-rock guitarrist Jules "FamilyJules" Conroy, funk bassist Alex Moukala, and composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist director Charlie Rosen, the director of the NYC-based ensemble _The 8-Bit Big Band_.

Out of the bunch, though, one particular musician stands out from the crowd for his unique background and approach to VGM performance and arrangement. Carlos Eiene (a.k.a insaneintherainmusic), a YouTuber/composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist who graduated from the Berkelee College of Music in 2020, has become a staple of the VGM community for his unique jazz-inspired remixes of famous tunes from _Undertale_, _Legend of Zelda_, _Super Mario_, _Persona 5_, and _Pokémon_.

According to Carlos himself, the soundtrack from the fourth generation of Pokémon games has had a profund impact on his musical development, being the very reason he got into Jazz music in the first place. As such, as his main endeavor for his final year at Berklee, Carlos was determined to put his energy into making the best musical tribute he could to a game which has been extremeley influential to him as a person and as a musician.

And so, in this edition of Album Review, I'd like to spend some time to talk about insaneintherainmusic's magnum opus of sorts - _Sinnohvation_, a 50-track tribute album to the soundtrack of _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_.

## Who is insaneintherainmusic?

Carlos Eiene is an American-Filipino composer, multi-instrumentalist and arranger from Seattle. He started recording his first jazz remixes of VGM tunes while he was still in high school. 

He is one of the few big names in the VGM scene with a background in Jazz. He studied Contemporary Composition and Jazz Performance at the Berkelee College of Music in Boston.

## The Album

The tracks in _Sinnohvation_ is comprised of mostly jazz-inspired arrangements of tracks from _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_. It's a  really, _**really**_ long album clocking in at just under 3 hours and 54 minutes of music. The tracks vary widly in length, with some lasting only 2 or 3 minutes, while most fall into the 4 to 6 minute category, which is appropritate for a colletion of jazz tunes, and some more ambitious tracks even dip into the 7 minute territory. 

The original soundtrack for _Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum_ was composed by GAME FREAK sound team members Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, Hitomi Sato and Morikazu Aoki, who all have a history of composing and producing songs for Pokémon games on the GBA, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.

It's arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a "insaneintherainmusic".

This album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.

The sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music.


### The Opening

The album starts off with [_Opening Movie_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJw6JAkkBTY&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=1), a recreation of the song that accompanies _Pokémon D/P/Pt_'s opening sequence. Arrangement-wise, it's a pretty faithful recreation at that, but what's impressive about this track is the tone it sets for the rest of the album. 

From the get-go, the listener is greeted with a twenty-piece student orchestra with strings, harp, grand piano, and bombastic brass. _Sinnohvation_ is, first and foremost, a (mostly )live-recorded studio album with a diverse set of passionate student musicians led by Carlos Eiene. The extensive use of human musicians as opposed to software/virtual instruments was a deliberate choice by Carlos, who once stated that 

> _"Not even the greatest MIDI [sound] library can come even close to a good performer. [It] doesn't quite replace the interaction you get between musicians in a room or a musician who spent hours and hours practicing a single note. That is something I really believe in - the power of live instruments"_.

The following track, [_Sinnohvation_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG1sTfsXnuI&list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&index=2). Long-time insaneintherainmusic fans might recognize this track as a re-arrangement/re-recording of Carlos's [_Professor Rowan's Lab_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PrCE_Vy0E) cover in the form of a recreation of the _Opening Sequence_ track from _D/P/Pt_'s OST. 

Carlos's single vocal verse in this track,

> _Welcome to Sinnoh, everybody! Here we go!_

followed by the energetic piano/string/sax/flute jam, is an invitation to the listener, who's about to embark in a 50-track, 3 hour and 50 minute-long journey across the musical landscape of Pokémon Gen. 4. 

So if you're really commited to embark on this musical quest, take an afternoon off, grab a seat and a pair of headphones, because this album takes the listener on a unique, interesting and often times charming adventure.

### The Journey Begins

The next couple of tracks, namely, _Twinleaf Town_ and _Route 201_, instantly remind you about the "Pokémon-iness" of this music collection. This is the start of your Pokémon-catching, Team Galactic-squashing, Gym Leader-battling adventure across the Sinnoh region, and there's no better way to start it than with the iconic home town theme and the first route theme.

_Twinleaf Town_ revolves around a cool and minimalist groove with a clean electric guitar, electric bass, drums and tenor sax, and slowly gets more energetic as the flutes and piano join the mix. Carlos' solo on the tenor sax clearly borrows tone and improvisation ideas from infamous jazz-fusion saxophonist Michael Brecker of the _The Brecker Brothers_.

On _Route 201_, the listener is instroduced to a fairly esoteric synthesizer-like instrument - the [_EWI_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)) (Electronic Wind Instrument), a woodwind-shaped MIDI controller, also made famous by Michael Brecker. Carlos' ability to take the simplistic melody of the original _Route 201_ theme and bring it to life with a rich instrumentation, unique reharmonization and jazz-fusion-like sound is immediately noticable. 

The following track, _Lake Verity_, is a more traditional jazz tune, with a song structure which clearly takes inspiration from the hard bop era. The alto/tenor/baritone saxophone solis, although simple at times, are a joy to listen to. In the head of the tune, the call and response interplay between saxophones and the electric jazz guitar/marimba duo, courtesy of jazz percussionist Doug Perry, is wonderful. The song as a whole is has a distinctly chill atmosphere which slowly builds energy and releases it all at once in the final sax soli.



## Where to Buy

_Sinnovation_ is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube/YouTube Music, Pandora, Deezer and Amazon Music.

Additionally, you can purchase the digital download in high-quality MP3 and FLAC on iTunes, Bandcamp and Amazon.

The album is also available as a 12" vinyl featuring the Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble tracks and as a 3-disc CD pack, both of which can be purchased on Bandcamp, though these are usually manufactured in small batches and are often sold out. Signed copies were available for some time in the latter part of 2020, but are already sold out.


## Verdict

Overall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and Pokémon fans alike. 

A solid **9/10**.
