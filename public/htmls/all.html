This is just a quick post about why I&#39;m removing all text justification from my website. I&#39;ve included links to additional resources and reading materials from folks that are much more qualified to write about this sort of stuff than I am.</em></p>
<p>Over the last couple of days, I noticed that the justified text on some of my posts can sometimes look quite jarring.
As an example, take a look at the following section from my <a href="http://34.200.98.64:3000/sinnohvation">review on <em>Sinnohvation</em></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/693296031982682184/851171575847321700/unknown.png?width=830&height=632" alt="image1"></p>
<p>Notice the (oftentimes huge) gaping holes between words. In particular, check out the 3rd line of the 3rd paragraph and the 2nd and 4th lines of the 4th paragraph. </p>
<p>It looks horrible. Atrocious. Awful. Disturbing. Ridiculous, even. Besides being unberably ugly, it makes text somewhat harder to read, and since I often invest a lot of time writing and proofreading these posts, I feel betrayed by ugly justification.</p>
<p>In web development/design, text justification is taken care of by  CSS (short for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>), a special language that goes hand in hand with HTML and whose sole purpose is to style webpages and make them prettier to the human eye. In CSS, we can specify <em>properties</em> which essentially tell the browser how it should render/display a certain part of your webpage. </p>
<p>Take a look at the following example CSS code snippet. Here, I&#39;m using a set of properties (<code>width</code>, <code>text-align</code>, <code>overflow-x</code>, etc.) to style a <code>div</code> with a class of <code>main</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.main {
  width: 800px;    
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  text-align: justify;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>text-align: justify;</code> property - basically, it&#39;s telling the broswer to take the text inside that <code>div</code> and <em>justify</em> it, which means stretching out the words so that they touch both the left and right-most edges of the <code>div</code>, in the same way that justified text on a book is stretched to align with the left and right margins of the page.</p>
<p>Earlier today I read <a href="https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/">this post</a> on <em>Design For Hackers</em> showing why <code>text-align: justify;</code> is so bad, and honestly, I agree with Mr. David Kadavy. In fact, after digging a little bit deeper, it appears that justified text on the web <a href="https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/why-does-justified-text-have-such-a-bad-reputation-on-the-web/">has had a bad reputation for quite some time</a>. Even worse, it often looks like a <a href="https://meetchopz.medium.com/10-bad-typography-habits-that-scream-amateur-8bac07f9c041">rookie typography mistake</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is becuase of the incredibly poor text justification algorithm used by CSS/HTML, since all it does is add gaps between words to stretch a line of text to touch the edges of a <code>div</code> container, without adding hyphenation, word-splitting or any other sort of modifications to the block of text. This seems to constrat starkly with the justification process in regular print media, notably, books and newspapers. <a href="http://theworldsgreatestbook.com/book-design-basics-hyphens-justification/">This post</a> by David Bricker in his <em>Book Design Basics</em> series does a good job of explaining how to use hyphenation to justify text for books.</p>
<p>So, for web developers/designers such as myself, it looks like the best option as of right now is to just ditch justification all together in favor of left-aligned text. Thankfully, all I need to do is to change a single line of CSS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.main {
  width: 800px;    
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  /* Begone, justified text! */
  text-align: left;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here&#39;s how that same section from my <em>Sinnohvation</em> review looks like now:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/693296031982682184/851171420952199198/unknown.png?width=858&height=631" alt="image"></p>
<p>While symmetrical, perfectly aligned blocks of text can look quite aesthetically pleasing in some books, they can really be an eyesore when it comes to webpages. For the time being, removing text justification seems to be a decent compromise.</p>
<p>Expect more typography and web design posts in the next couple of weeks as I spend a little more time working on my website, including improving my webpage generator/templating system, learning responsive design, and improving readability, and adding even more âœ¨fancy CSSâœ¨.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;m going to try out some Javascript. This is the classic memoized Fibonacci sequence program in JS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var fibList = [];

function fib(num) {
  if (num == 1 || num == 2) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fib(num-1) + fib(num-2);
  }
}

function main(num){
  console.log(&quot;The first &quot; + num + &quot;Fibonacci numbers are: &quot;);
  for (var i = 1; i &lt; num+1; i++) {
    fibNum = fib(i);
    console.log(&quot;Fib number &quot; + i + &quot;: &quot; + fibNum);
  }
}

main(50);

<div class="post"><h1 id="how-i-made-my-personal-website">How I made my personal website</h1>
<hr>
<div class="header"><div class="date">Published on 2021-5-30</div><div class="groups">Groups: <a href="/all">all</a>, <a href="/programming">programming</a>, <a href="/webdesign">webdesign</a></div></div><p><strong><em>This page is still a work-in progress!</em></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This is a little guide for those who might be interested in knowing how this website was made and the rationale behind of the decisions that I made while building this website</p>
<p>The full source code for my website is available <a href="https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I don&#39;t have any experience at all when it comes to building websites. I&#39;ve never tried services like Squarespace or Wix or Wordpress, and I&#39;ve yet to try using a static website generator like Jekyll or Hugo, but I&#39;ve heard that these tools/services can yield some pretty interesting results.</p>
<p>In fact, a good friend of mine who&#39;s also a programmer uses Hugo on <a href="https://bykoga.com/">his personal website</a> and it ended up looking quite spiffy!</p>
<p>But instead of diving straight into learning how to to use some sort of website making tool, I wanted to build something myself that I had almost complete control over and that abstracted the least amount of code away from me. In other words, I wanted to build my website from near scratch. </p>
<p>I have some experience building some basic full-stack web applications with Node.js, but no experience so far with frontend libraries like React, Angular or Vue. Naturally I chose Node as my backend and wrote all the front-end stuff in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="my-vision">My vision</h2>
<p>Content-wise, I wanted a reasonably simple website for displaying a couple of blog-style posts in which I could talk about anything to my heart&#39;s content: music, coding, science, technology, you name it.</p>
<p>I wanted to build a system that made it ease for me to write new posts without having to mess around with complicated databases and third-party libraries (both for the frontend and backend) had to be kept to a minimum to reduce complexity.</p>
<p>And for whoever might be consuming content on this website, I wanted them to be greeted with something that was minimalist in nature to avoid distractions, but still somewhat aesthetically pleasing. I also wanted to build something that made it easy to browse posts and topics easily and quickly, in the case that the reader wished to do so.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>To meet these goals, I came up with the following system.</p>
<p>Unlike static site generators, where the full HTML for the pages is already laid out and ready to be served to the website&#39;s client, I chose to use a dynamic site generator, where the server is responsible for building the webpage on-the-fly. It&#39;s probably not as efficient as a pure static file server, but it has proven to be working quite well, at least for now.</p>
<p>The Node.js server script would process the incoming request and pass some information to the generator, which would generate and return the appropriate HTML to the server, which  would serve the final webpage to the client.</p>
<p>As far as the actual posts go, I chose to go with Markdown (.md) files which contain both metadata in YAML and actual text written in Markdown. The server-side script splits the file in half and parses the YAML with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml">JS-YAML</a> to extract the metadata and the actual text with <a href="https://marked.js.org/">Marked.js</a> to convert Markdown into pure HTML, which can be rendered by a web browser.</p>
<p>Markdown makes it super duper easy to write nicely formatted text with headers, section, subsections, links, images, etc. It&#39;s mush less cumbersome than raw HTML and writing and formatting text-based content, but since it can&#39;t be rendered by a browser, it needs to be converted to HTML somehow first, which is where Marked.js comes in.</p>
<h2 id="creating-posts">Creating Posts</h2>
<p>New posts are created by simply creating a new Markdown (.md) file in a specific directory and populating it with: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>a YAML front matter (basically a header with some metadata) in a similar manner to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, with the post&#39;s title, templates, groups and publishing date, like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">Hi, I&#39;m Lucca and this is my personal webpage.

Here you&#39;ll find lots of programming, music, electronics and life shenanigans.

Check the sidebar to the left for essays, posts, project write-ups, interesting/relevant links and more.

Wanna see how this website was built? [Check out the GitHub repo.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/personal-website)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And something like this will be generated in real-time, as soon as the request to the page is made:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/760252264723644426/848589820125249566/unknown.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Notice how the title is clearly displayed at the top with a big, readable font and a horizontal line that makes it stand out from the rest of the post. The date in which the post was made and groups in which the post belongs are neatly shown under the horizontal line in unobtrusive italicized text with a gray color.</p>
<p>This system certainly accomplishes the goal of being easy to write posts and modify them if I need to, but I think the true beauty comes from the fact that all the information is neatly stored in a human-readable single file.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>The generator features a basic templating engine as well.</p>
<p>To include a template, simply specify which template file to include in the <code>templates</code> section in the post&#39;s front matter. The file must be included in the <code>/public/templates/</code> directory <em>(check example below)</em>. </p>
<p>By default, two templates called <code>base.html</code> and <code>base.css</code> are included with every single page.</p>
<p>There&#39;s even a nifty template for fetching GitHub READMEs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
templates: [github-fetch.md]
groups: [all, github-readme, me]
github-url: https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-Website 
date: 2021-05-27 14:33:00
---
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>base.html</code>, <code>base.css</code> and <code>github-fetch.md</code> templates are included with the post.</p>
<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<p>Posts can be filered by groups by simply visiting <code>www.websiteurl.net/group-name</code>, which will display all posts that belong in the group <em>group-name</em>, from newest to oldest.</p>
<p>Groups basically work like tags for your posts.</p>
<p>To assign groups to posts, specify which groups that post should belong to in the <code>groups</code> section in the post&#39;s front matter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">title: My thoughts on Daft Punk&#39;s _Random Access Memories_
templates: []
groups: [all, album-review, music, daft-punk]
date: 2021-05-27 12:00:00
</code></pre>
<p>The above example post would show up in the <em>all</em>, <em>album-review</em>, <em>music</em> and <em>daft-punk</em> groups.</p>
<h2 id="the-all-powerful-website-generator">The all-powerful website generator</h2>
<p>Okay so obviously, my website generator is quite limited in what it can do, so it&#39;s pretty damn far from &quot;all-powerful&quot;, but it&#39;s the one doing the heavylifting behind this website. It&#39;s not very flexible, but at least it gets the job done, in addition to being  easy to maintain and expand on.</p>
<p>This is basically how the generator works:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Templates</strong>: the generator loads some base templates in the form of some HTML and CSS. It includes whatever additional templates are required for a specific page.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Metadata</strong>: the generator then loads the metadata for a specific post - these would be things like the title, date, and groups (a sort of tagging system I developed). The information in the metadata would be displayed in the page&#39;s header and could also be used by the server to filter posts by groups, sort them by date, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Content</strong>: then, the generator gets the post&#39;s actual content. Since it&#39;s still in plain Markdown, it reads the content, and parses it with Marked.js to get raw HTML.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Serve page</strong>: finally, the server bundles it up into a single HTML file to and sends it out to the client as the body of the HTTP response.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The YouTube-based VGM (videogame music) cover scene has grown a lot over the last couple of years. While you might think that it&#39;s still a tiny space in the huge world of music productions on the video streaming platform, chances are, you&#39;ve probably encountered one of the many up and coming VGM artists, especially if you watch anything gaming-related on YouTube.</p>
<p>As more and more people (especially  teenagers and young adults) get into the increasingly accessible world of gaming, fueled by the release of novel gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the ever-growing quality of both big-budget and indie game titles, the demand for videogame soundtracks and covers will follow. As such, a new niche in the vast realm of in the internet was formed: the world of VGM covers, populated by amateur and professional musicians alike, who record their own renditions of tunes from the games they love and share them with a passionate community of gamers and music fans.</p>
<p>Some of the YouTube&#39;s most notable VGM cover artists include a capella singer Max &quot;Smooth McGroove&quot; Gleason, drummer/Twitch streamer Jerod &quot;The8BitDrummer&quot; Collins, singer/songwriter Adriana &quot;Adrisaurus&quot; Figueroa, metal-rock guitarrist Jules &quot;FamilyJules&quot; Conroy, funk bassist Alex Moukala, and composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist director Charlie Rosen, the director of the NYC-based ensemble <em>The 8-Bit Big Band</em>.</p>
<p>Out of the bunch, though, one particular musician stands out from the crowd for his unique background and approach to VGM performance and arrangement. Carlos Eiene (a.k.a insaneintherainmusic), a YouTuber/composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist who graduated from the Berkelee College of Music in 2020, has become a staple of the VGM community for his unique jazz-inspired remixes of famous tunes from <em>Undertale</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Persona 5</em>, and <em>PokÃ©mon</em> games.</p>
<p>According to Carlos himself, the soundtrack from the fourth generation of PokÃ©mon games has had a profund impact on his musical development, being the very reason he got into Jazz music in the first place. So, as his main endeavor for his final year at Berklee, Carlos was determined to put his energy into making the best musical tribute he could to a game which has been extremeley influential to him as a person and as a musician.</p>
<p>And so, in this edition of Album Review, I&#39;d like to spend some time to talk about insaneintherainmusic&#39;s magnum opus of sorts - <em>Sinnohvation</em>, a tribute album to the soundtrack of <em>PokÃ©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em>.</p>
<!-- ## Who is insaneintherainmusic?

Carlos Eiene is an American-Filipino composer, multi-instrumentalist and arranger from Seattle. He started recording his first jazz remixes of VGM tunes while he was still in high school. 

He is one of the few big names in the VGM scene with a background in Jazz. He studied Contemporary Composition and Jazz Performance at the Berkelee College of Music in Boston.  -->

<hr>
<h2 id="the-album">The Album</h2>
<p><em>Sinnohvation</em> is comprised of mostly jazz-inspired arrangements of tracks from the <em>PokÃ©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em> games. It&#39;s a  really, <em><strong>really</strong></em> long album clocking in at 3 hours and 50 minutes of music. The tracks vary widly in length, with some lasting only 2 or 3 minutes, while most fall into the 4 to 6 minute category (an appropriate length for a colletion of jazz tunes), and some more ambitious tracks even dip into the 7 minute territory. </p>
<p>The original soundtrack for <em>PokÃ©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em> was composed by GAME FREAK sound team members Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, Hitomi Sato and Morikazu Aoki, who all have a history of composing and producing songs for PokÃ©mon games on the GBA, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<!-- It's arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a "insaneintherainmusic".

This album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the PokÃ©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.

The sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music. -->


<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>The album starts off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJw6JAkkBTY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=1"><em>Opening Movie</em></a>, a recreation of the song that accompanies <em>PokÃ©mon D/P/Pt</em>&#39;s opening sequence. Arrangement-wise, it&#39;s a pretty faithful recreation at that, but what&#39;s impressive about this track is the tone it sets for the rest of the album. </p>
<p>From the get-go, the listener is greeted with a twenty-piece student orchestra with strings, harp, grand piano, and bombastic brass. <em>Sinnohvation</em> is, first and foremost, a (mostly )live-recorded studio album with a diverse set of passionate student musicians led by Carlos Eiene. The extensive use of human musicians as opposed to software/virtual instruments was a deliberate choice by Carlos, who once stated that </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Not even the greatest MIDI [sound] library can come even close to a good performer. [It] doesn&#39;t quite replace the interaction you get between musicians in a room or a musician who spent hours and hours practicing a single note. That is something I really believe in - the power of live instruments&quot;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG1sTfsXnuI&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=2"><em>Sinnohvation</em></a>, the namesake of the album. Long-time insaneintherainmusic fans might recognize this track as a re-arrangement/re-recording of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PrCE_Vy0E"><em>Professor Rowan&#39;s Lab</em></a> cover in the form of a recreation of the <em>Opening Sequence</em> track from <em>D/P/Pt</em>&#39;s OST. </p>
<p>Carlos&#39;s single vocal verse in this track,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Welcome to Sinnoh, everybody! Here we go!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed by the energetic piano/string/sax/flute jam, is an invitation to the listener, who&#39;s about to embark in a 50-track, 3 hour and 50 minute-long journey across the musical landscape of PokÃ©mon Gen. 4. </p>
<p>So if you&#39;re really commited to follow along with this musical quest, take an afternoon off, grab a seat and a pair of headphones, because this album takes the listener on a unique, interesting and often times charming adventure.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-begins">The Journey Begins</h3>
<p>The next couple of tracks, namely, <em>Twinleaf Town</em> and <em>Route 201</em>, instantly remind you about the &quot;PokÃ©mon-iness&quot; of this music collection. This is the beginning of your PokÃ©mon-catching, Team Galactic-squashing, Gym Leader-battling adventure across the Sinnoh region, and there&#39;s no better way to start it than with the iconic home town theme and the first route theme.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlm8kIulpo&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=3"><em>Twinleaf Town</em></a> revolves around a cool and minimalist groove with a clean electric guitar, electric bass, drums and tenor sax, and slowly gets more energetic as the flutes and piano join the mix. Carlos&#39; solo on the tenor sax clearly borrows tone and improvisation ideas from infamous jazz-fusion saxophonist Michael Brecker of the <em>The Brecker Brothers</em>. This tune is </p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD5sJO0Y7Nk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=4"><em>Route 201</em></a>, the listener is instroduced to a fairly esoteric synthesizer-like instrument - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)"><em>EWI</em></a> (Electronic Wind Instrument), a woodwind-shaped MIDI controller, also made famous by Michael Brecker. Carlos&#39; ability to take the simplistic melody of the original <em>Route 201</em> theme and bring it to life with a rich instrumentation, unique reharmonization and jazz-fusion-like sound is immediately noticable. </p>
<p>The following track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXajUkHjghk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=5"><em>Lake Verity</em></a>, features jazz percussionist Doug Perry on vibraphone. It&#39;s a more traditional jazz tune, with a song structure and instrumentation which clearly takes inspiration from the hard bop era. The alto/tenor/baritone saxophone solis, although simple at times, are a joy to listen to. In the head of the tune, the playful call and response between saxophones and the electric jazz guitar/vibes duo is a small touch, but it&#39;s wonderfully well executed. The song as a whole is has a distinctly chill atmosphere which slowly builds energy and releases it all at once in the final sax soli.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-buy">Where to Buy</h2>
<p><em>Sinnovation</em> is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube/YouTube Music, Pandora, Deezer and Amazon Music.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can purchase the digital download in high-quality MP3 and FLAC on iTunes, Bandcamp and Amazon.</p>
<p>The album is also available as a 12&quot; vinyl featuring the Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble tracks and as a 3-disc CD pack, both of which can be purchased on Bandcamp, though these are usually manufactured in small batches and are often sold out. Signed copies were available for some time in the latter part of 2020, but are already sold out.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>Overall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and PokÃ©mon fans alike. </p>
<p>A solid <strong>9/10</strong>.</p>
