<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The YouTube-based VGM (videogame music) cover scene has grown a lot over the last couple of years. While you might think that it&#39;s still a tiny space in the huge world of music productions on the video streaming platform, chances are, you&#39;ve probably encountered one of the many up and coming VGM artists, especially if you watch anything gaming-related on YouTube.</p>
<p>As more and more people (especially  teenagers and young adults) get into the increasingly accessible world of gaming, fueled by the release of novel gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the ever-growing quality of both big-budget and indie game titles, the demand for videogame soundtracks and covers will follow. As such, a new niche in the vast realm of in the internet was formed: the world of VGM covers, populated by amateur and professional musicians alike, who record their own renditions of tunes from the games they love and share them with a passionate community of gamers and music fans.</p>
<p>Some of the YouTube&#39;s most notable VGM cover artists include a capella singer Max &quot;Smooth McGroove&quot; Gleason, drummer/Twitch streamer Jerod &quot;The8BitDrummer&quot; Collins, singer/songwriter Adriana &quot;Adrisaurus&quot; Figueroa, metal-rock guitarrist Jules &quot;FamilyJules&quot; Conroy, funk bassist Alex Moukala, and composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist director Charlie Rosen, the director of the NYC-based ensemble <em>The 8-Bit Big Band</em>.</p>
<p>Out of the bunch, though, one particular musician stands out from the crowd for his unique background and approach to VGM performance and arrangement. Carlos Eiene (a.k.a insaneintherainmusic), a YouTuber/composer/arranger/multi-instrumentalist who graduated from the Berkelee College of Music in 2020, has become a staple of the VGM community for his unique jazz-inspired remixes of famous tunes from <em>Undertale</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series, <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Persona 5</em>, and <em>Pok√©mon</em> games.</p>
<p>According to Carlos himself, the soundtrack from the fourth generation of Pok√©mon games has had a profund impact on his musical development, being the very reason he got into Jazz music in the first place. So, as his main endeavor for his final year at Berklee, Carlos was determined to put his energy into making the best musical tribute he could to a game which has been extremeley influential to him as a person and as a musician.</p>
<p>And so, in this edition of Album Review, I&#39;d like to spend some time to talk about insaneintherainmusic&#39;s magnum opus of sorts - <em>Sinnohvation</em>, a tribute album to the soundtrack of <em>Pok√©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em>.</p>
<!-- ## Who is insaneintherainmusic?

Carlos Eiene is an American-Filipino composer, multi-instrumentalist and arranger from Seattle. He started recording his first jazz remixes of VGM tunes while he was still in high school. 

He is one of the few big names in the VGM scene with a background in Jazz. He studied Contemporary Composition and Jazz Performance at the Berkelee College of Music in Boston.  -->

<h2 id="the-album">The Album</h2>
<p><em>Sinnohvation</em> is comprised of mostly jazz-inspired arrangements of tracks from the <em>Pok√©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em> games. It&#39;s a  really, <em><strong>really</strong></em> long album clocking in at 3 hours and 50 minutes of music. The tracks vary widly in length, with some lasting only 2 or 3 minutes, while most fall into the 4 to 6 minute category (an appropriate length for a colletion of jazz tunes), and some more ambitious tracks even dip into the 7 minute territory. </p>
<p>The original soundtrack for <em>Pok√©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</em> was composed by GAME FREAK sound team members Junichi Masuda, Go Ichinose, Hitomi Sato and Morikazu Aoki, who all have a history of composing and producing songs for Pok√©mon games on the GBA, Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<!-- It's arguably the best album released so far by the youtuber/Berklee College of Music grad/multi-instrumentalist extraordinaire/cowbell virtuoso/tenor sax mainer/jazz madlad Carlos Eiene, a.k.a "insaneintherainmusic".

This album features jazz arrangements of 50 iconic tunes from the Pok√©mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum soundtrack with almost 4 hours of jazzy greatness.

The sheer number (60+) of featured and guest musicians on this album is rarely heard of, even in the highest production quality albums in the history of modern music. -->


<h3 id="opening">Opening</h3>
<p>The album starts off with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJw6JAkkBTY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=1"><em>Opening Movie</em></a>, a recreation of the song that accompanies <em>Pok√©mon D/P/Pt</em>&#39;s opening sequence. Arrangement-wise, it&#39;s a pretty faithful recreation at that, but what&#39;s impressive about this track is the tone it sets for the rest of the album. </p>
<p>From the get-go, the listener is greeted with a twenty-piece student orchestra with strings, harp, grand piano, and bombastic brass. <em>Sinnohvation</em> is, first and foremost, a (mostly )live-recorded studio album with a diverse set of passionate student musicians led by Carlos Eiene. The extensive use of human musicians as opposed to software/virtual instruments was a deliberate choice by Carlos, who once stated that </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Not even the greatest MIDI [sound] library can come even close to a good performer. [It] doesn&#39;t quite replace the interaction you get between musicians in a room or a musician who spent hours and hours practicing a single note. That is something I really believe in - the power of live instruments&quot;</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG1sTfsXnuI&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=2"><em>Sinnohvation</em></a>, the namesake of the album. Long-time insaneintherainmusic fans might recognize this track as a re-arrangement/re-recording of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6PrCE_Vy0E"><em>Professor Rowan&#39;s Lab</em></a> cover in the form of a recreation of the <em>Opening Sequence</em> track from <em>D/P/Pt</em>&#39;s OST. </p>
<p>Carlos&#39;s single vocal verse in this track,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Welcome to Sinnoh, everybody! Here we go!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed by the energetic piano/string/sax/flute jam, is an invitation to the listener, who&#39;s about to embark in a 50-track, 3 hour and 50 minute-long journey across the musical landscape of Pok√©mon Gen. 4. </p>
<p>So if you&#39;re really commited to follow along with this musical quest, take an afternoon off, grab a seat and a pair of headphones, because this album takes the listener on a unique, interesting and often times charming adventure.</p>
<h3 id="the-journey-begins">The Journey Begins</h3>
<p>The next couple of tracks, namely, <em>Twinleaf Town</em> and <em>Route 201</em>, instantly remind you about the &quot;Pok√©mon-iness&quot; of this music collection. This is the beginning of your Pok√©mon-catching, Team Galactic-squashing, Gym Leader-battling adventure across the Sinnoh region, and there&#39;s no better way to start it than with the iconic home town theme and the first route theme.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlm8kIulpo&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=3"><em>Twinleaf Town</em></a> revolves around a cool and minimalist groove with a clean electric guitar, electric bass, drums and tenor sax, and slowly gets more energetic as the flutes and piano join the mix. Carlos&#39; solo on the tenor sax clearly borrows tone and improvisation ideas from infamous jazz-fusion saxophonist Michael Brecker of the <em>The Brecker Brothers</em>. This tune is </p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD5sJO0Y7Nk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=4"><em>Route 201</em></a>, the listener is instroduced to a fairly esoteric synthesizer-like instrument - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)"><em>EWI</em></a> (Electronic Wind Instrument), a woodwind-shaped MIDI controller, also made famous by Michael Brecker. Carlos&#39; ability to take the simplistic melody of the original <em>Route 201</em> theme and bring it to life with a rich instrumentation, unique reharmonization and jazz-fusion-like sound is immediately noticable. </p>
<p>The following track, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXajUkHjghk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nAMy4Tld9n9JY8r-56mo1HHunMpLCcAcI&amp;index=5"><em>Lake Verity</em></a>, features jazz percussionist Doug Perry on vibraphone. It&#39;s a more traditional jazz tune, with a song structure and instrumentation which clearly takes inspiration from the hard bop era. The alto/tenor/baritone saxophone solis, although simple at times, are a joy to listen to. In the head of the tune, the playful call and response between saxophones and the electric jazz guitar/vibes duo is a small touch, but it&#39;s wonderfully well executed. The song as a whole is has a distinctly chill atmosphere which slowly builds energy and releases it all at once in the final sax soli.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-buy">Where to Buy</h2>
<p><em>Sinnovation</em> is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube/YouTube Music, Pandora, Deezer and Amazon Music.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can purchase the digital download in high-quality MP3 and FLAC on iTunes, Bandcamp and Amazon.</p>
<p>The album is also available as a 12&quot; vinyl featuring the Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble tracks and as a 3-disc CD pack, both of which can be purchased on Bandcamp, though these are usually manufactured in small batches and are often sold out. Signed copies were available for some time in the latter part of 2020, but are already sold out.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>Overall, a fantastic album and a must-listen for jazz, VGM and Pok√©mon fans alike. </p>
<p>A solid <strong>9/10</strong>.</p>

<p>Everything about this album screams <em>~disco~</em>. Daft Punk&#39;s flashy suits in the promotional material, the music videos for <em>Get Lucky</em> and <em>Lose Yourself to Dance</em>, Nile Rodgers&#39; iconic funky rhythm guitar lines, the funky bass lines, the musical production and featured collaborators...</p>
<p>It&#39;s a far cry from the sleek, futuristic aesthetic that Daft Punk built with <em>Discovery</em> (nevermind <em>Human After All</em> &#39;s roughness and lack of polish), but <em>RAM</em> was never meant to be the next big thing in electronica. It&#39;s a flashback, a blast to past delivered in Daft Punk&#39;s authentic and beautifully crafted homage to the sounds and grooves of 70&#39;s/80&#39;s pop, disco, and synth-funk.</p>
<p>I still plan on writing a full review for this album as soon as I find the time to do so. But in the meantime, stop wasting *your* time and go give <em>RAM</em> a listen if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Arguably the best album ever made by Daft Punk. I keep arguing with myself all the freaking time on which album is better, <em>Discovery</em> or <em>RAM</em>.</p>
<p>I still plan on writing a full review for this album, but for the time being, just drop whatever you&#39;re doing right and go give this LP a listen. You can thank me later. Even 20 years after <em>Discovery&#39;s</em> release, all 14 of the album&#39;s groovy, emotional, and energetic electro-disco-funk tracks have definitely aged like fine wine. </p>
<p>Long live the masters of French house.</p>
<p>A solid <strong>9 out of a 10</strong>. </p>
