Welcome! This is the user manual for RedstoneBot.

This short guide will show you how to add and setup RedstoneBot for your Discord server.

_Looking for how to create a clone of RedstoneBot instead? [Take a look here.](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot#usage-ubuntu-linux)_

  

## Step 1: Add Redstone to your Discord server

[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769761270269476887&permissions=8&scope=bot) to add Redstone to your server.

Choose the server you want to add Redstone to and complete the Captcha.

Next, you'll need to give Redstone permission to open and close your server.  
  
  

## Step 2: Give RedstoneBot permission to control your PloudOS server

Login to [PloudOS](https://ploudos.com) and access your server list [here](http://ploudos.com/server/).

Next, choose the server you want Redstone to control (Note: you must be the server's owner).

Open the server's management page.

Scroll down and click the "Share Server" tab on the bottom left.

Share your server with the user **RedstoneBot**. Give it permission to open/close your server and access the console by selecting the appropriate checkboxes, as shown below. Finally, click the "Share" button.

Hang on, we're almost there!  
  
  

## Step 3: Run the _setup_ command

Open Discord on your [browser](https://discord.com/app) or desktop. Then, go to the server you just added Redstone to.

_Protip: if you haven't already, you might want to create a separate channel or category just for bots and mute it. Bots are annoying, sometimes._ ðŸ˜•

Now, you'll need to link your Discord server to the PloudOS server you want Redstone to control.

All you need to do is run the _setup_ command and specify your server's IP address, like so:

```js
!redstone setup myverycoolserver.ploudos.me
```

If all goes well, you'll get a confirmation message. If you entered an incorrect/invalid IP, just try again.

If you're sure you're entering a valid IP but didn't get the message in the picture above, then please make sure Redstone has permissions to manage your server, as described in step 2.




## Step 4: Assign Roles

At this point, you should be all set if you plan on using RedstoneBot on your own. But of course, one of RedstoneBot's main features is to provide an easier UI for your friends to control your PloudOS Minecraft server, and to do this, you'll need to create and assign roles within your Discord server.

Right click on your server name or icon and head to **Server Settings** and then **Roles**.

Create a new role called **Redstone User**. No need to change the role's permissions. Users with this role can use basic commands, such as **_status_**, **_list_**, **_time_**, and start your PloudOS server with the **_start_** command.

Optionally, create a new role called **Redstone Admin**. This role requires only the default permissions as well. Users with this role can use all RedstoneBot commands, including stopping the server with **_stop_**, leaving the actication queue with **_exit_**, and use configuration commands such as **_setup_** and **_reset_**.

**NOTE:** Users with admin permissions already default to Redstone Admins, so no need to assign these roles to yourself or other admins within your server.

## Done! Redstone is ready to roll.

That's all there is to it! To make sure RedstoneBot is working properly, use the **_status_** command, like so:

```js
!redstone status
```
