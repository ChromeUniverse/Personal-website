Ever since I got back into web development some 6-ish weeks ago by enrolling in Scrimba's [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course, I started looking for ways to brush up on my HTML and CSS before diving deeper into React, as I feeling a bit rusty. üòÖ

As luck would have it, I stumbled into [Alana](https://alanacapcreates.com/), a fellow Scrimba coder who was solving a web dev coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](frontendmentor.io) live on Twitch. One look at their collection of project challenges, and I was hooked. I've now been building FEM's projects for a little over a month and my frontend skills have improved drastically. üôÇ

This week I finished this cool [multi-theme Calculator app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29) and I even managed to write my own algorithm from scratch to mimic the behavior of the iPhone's classic calculator app. Wanna know how I did it? Keep reading to find out!

Warning - there will be a fair amount of React lingo in the coming sections, but I'm sure you already saw that coming. üòú

## Getting started

### Setting up React + Vite

I decided to build this project with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). If you're reading this article, I'm sure you're already familiar with both, but in case you aren't:
- **React** is a JavaScript library for building highly interactive web UIs in a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) fashion
- **Vite** is both a JS source code bundler built on top of [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and a high-performance dev server with [HMR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) and other cool stuff under the hood

The best way to try out Vite is by following the [official guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). If you've already built a React project with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), then you'll be glad to know Vite is a drop-in replacement for CRA - it scaffolds a basic React app and adds all the basic dependencies, and all you need to do is install them with NPM/Yarn and get to coding. 

Vite is fast - like, *really* fast - and honestly, you should probably consider [ditching CRA in favor of Vite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m14f0ZzMyY&t=3360s) for your future React projects.

### FEM Starter Files

Frontend Mentor offers both [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Figma](figma.com) designs if you sign up for their [Pro tier](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro). Free tier peasants like us only get the free starter files: assets (images, logos, SVG icons, etc.), design previews, and a basic style guide with fonts and colors. You can get the starter files for this project by visiting the [challenge page on Frontend Mentor's website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).

FEM's free style guides are *okay* at best, but you'll still have to guess a lot of stuff to get your layout right. One way to reduce the guesswork is to use graphics software like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and analyze the design previews - this way you can get the correct height, width, margin, and padding values for your DOM elements.

## Layout and CSS

As much as I'm a big fan of coupling your UI with styling (i.e. [Vue SFCs](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html#introduction), [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) or [Tailwind](tailwindcss.com)), implementing visual layouts and building UI components are still fundamentally different problems. Big shocker: planning your layout is usually easier compared to designing your UI logic, so start with the former!

![img](/images/calculator-layout-1.png)

As shown above, a smart combination of [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) and [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) can achieve our desired layout. A vertical Flex container can wrap the entire calculator, while a horizontal Flex container can wrap the header elements. The keypad can use a simple 4x5 Grid, and the larger "**RESET**" and "**=**" keys can be positioned with [Grid areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area).

![img](/images/calculator-layout-2.png)

Additionally, by using Inkscape, you can draw neon-colored rectangles with reduced opacities (<50%), lay them over elements of the design preview, and adjust the rectangles' edges to match your target element to get the values you want. I used this method in the example above to get the Grid row/column gaps for the keypad, which are both ~24 pixels.

## Using React Context for the themes

According to the [official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html): 

> _**Context** provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level._
> 
> _In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree._
>
> _Context is designed to share data that can be considered ‚Äúglobal‚Äù for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, **theme**, or preferred language._

Well, there you go, using Contexts in React is a perfect way to implement themes! Once you set up your theme context, you can use the current theme value in any component since it's treated as a "global" piece of app state.

The docs mostly show Contexts in class-based components, but since we're *cool kids* üòé, we only build apps with functional components - so instead take a look at the [Context hook API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) for more information on the topic.

I'll show you a real-world implementation of contexts and multiple themes in the following section, so keep reading!

## Building out the components

Here are all my custom components overlaid on the design preview so you can have an idea of which UI elements they represent.

![img](/images/calculator-components.png)


### Main App component

But before we take a look at custom components, it's worth taking a look at how they're composed inside the top-most `<App/>` component.

```jsx
// App.jsx

import React, { createContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";

// components
import Header from "./components/Header";
import Display from "./components/Display";
import Keypad from "./components/Keypad";

// theme stylesheets
import './css/theme-1.css'
import './css/theme-2.css'
import './css/theme-3.css'

// context for themes
export const ThemeContext = createContext();

function App() {

  // state
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(1);
  const [primary, setPrimary] = useState('');
  const [secondary, setSecondary] = useState('');
  const [operator, setOperator] = useState(false);
  const [hold, setHold] = useState();
  const [previous, setPrevious] = useState('');

  // ------------------------------------------------
  // various functions, hooks, and event handlers...
  // ------------------------------------------------

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <main className={`main theme-${theme}-main`}>
        <div className="calc">
          <Header setTheme={setTheme} />
          <Display value={primary} />
          <Keypad
            addChar={addChar}
            delChar={delChar}
            reset={reset}
            handleOperator={handleOperator}
            handleEquals={handleEquals}
          />
        </div>
      </main>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;

```

### Header

The `<Header/>` component represents the the tiny "**calc**" logo in the top-left corner as well as the theme toggle at the top-right corner. The toggle itself is made of 3 "ghost" (i.e. invisible) `div`s that represent the 3 different toggle positions as well as a visible toggle switch indicating the currently selected theme.

It takes only a single prop: a `setState`-type function to set the theme state variable in `<App/>`, depending on which "ghost" element in the theme toggle was clicked.

```jsx
// header.jsx

import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "../App";

function Header({ setTheme }) {

  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  const positions = [5, 28, 50];

  const style = {
    left: `${positions[theme-1]}px`
  }

  return (
    <header className="header">
      <p className={`header-logo theme-${theme}-header-logo`}>calc</p>

      <div className="header-switch">
        <p className={`header-switch-prompt theme-${theme}-header-switch-prompt`}>Theme</p>
        <div className={`header-switch-container theme-${theme}-header-switch-container`}>

          {/* actual visible toggle */}
          <div style={style} className={`header-switch-slider header-switch-toggle theme-${theme}-header-switch-toggle`}></div>

          {/* ghost slider positions */}
          <div
            className="header-switch-slider ghost ghost-1"
            onClick={() => setTheme(1)}
          ></div>
          <div
            className="header-switch-slider ghost ghost-2"
            onClick={() => setTheme(2)}
          ></div>
          <div
            className="header-switch-slider ghost ghost-3"
            onClick={() => setTheme(3)}
          ></div>

          {/* slider position text indicators */}
          <div className="header-switch-positions">
            <p className={`header-switch-position theme-${theme}-header-switch-position`}>1</p>
            <p className={`header-switch-position theme-${theme}-header-switch-position`}>2</p>
            <p className={`header-switch-position theme-${theme}-header-switch-position`}>3</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;

```

### Display

This is the simplest component of all - it just takes in a `prop` with the value to be shown in the calculator's display.

```jsx
// display.jsx

import React, { useContext } from 'react'

import { ThemeContext } from '../App';

function Display({value}) {

  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div className={`display theme-${theme}-display`}>
      <p className={`display-text theme-${theme}-display-text`}>
        {value[value.length-1] === '.' ? value : parseFloat(Number(value).toFixed(7))}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Display
```

### Keypad

This is the parent component for the calculator's actual keys - it doesn't take any special props other than various event handler functions that will be passed down to the appropriate `<Key/>` child components.

```jsx
// keypad.jsx

import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "../App";
import Key from "./Key";

function Keypad({ addChar, delChar, reset, handleOperator, handleEquals }) {

  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div className={`keypad theme-${theme}-keypad`}>
      <Key text="7" onClick={() => addChar(7)}/>
      <Key text="8" onClick={() => addChar(8)}/>
      <Key text="9" onClick={() => addChar(9)}/>
      <Key text="del" type={1} onClick={() => delChar()}/>
      <Key text="4" onClick={() => addChar(4)}/>
      <Key text="5" onClick={() => addChar(5)}/>
      <Key text="6" onClick={() => addChar(6)}/>
      <Key text="+" onClick={() => handleOperator(0)}/>
      <Key text="1" onClick={() => addChar(1)}/>
      <Key text="2" onClick={() => addChar(2)}/>
      <Key text="3" onClick={() => addChar(3)}/>
      <Key text="-" onClick={() => handleOperator(1)}/>
      <Key text="." onClick={() => addChar('.')}/>
      <Key text="0" onClick={() => addChar(0)}/>
      <Key text="/" onClick={() => handleOperator(3)}/>
      <Key text="x" onClick={() => handleOperator(2)}/>
      <Key text="reset" type={1} area="reset" onClick={() => reset()}/>
      <Key text="=" type={2} area="equals" onClick={() => handleEquals()}/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Keypad;

```


### Key

This component represents the actual clickable keys. It takes in `props` for the text to be displayed, an `onClick()` event handler as defined by the parent `<Keypad/>` component  as well as what `type` of key this is (this is just used for styling purposes). 

Type `0` means a regular key (hence 0 being a default value), `1` is for the "**DEL**" and "**RESET**" keys, and `2` for the "**=**" key.

```jsx
// key.jsx

import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "../App";

function Key({ text, type = 0, area = "", onClick }) {

  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div
      className={`
        key theme-${theme}-key
        ${type === 1 ? `key-type-1 theme-${theme}-key-type-1` : ""}
        ${type === 2 ? `key-type-2 theme-${theme}-key-type-2` : ""}
        ${area !== "" ? `key-area-${area}` : ""}
      `}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      <p className="key-text">{text}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Key;

```

## Adding multiple themes

As you might have noticed in the code snippets above, all of the components are importing a Context provider called `ThemeContext` from `App.jsx` and extracting the currently selected theme with the `useContext()` hook. I managed to implement the theming system by combining the Contexts with React's **conditional rendering** and **separate stylesheets** for each theme.

### Conditional rendering in React

First, you might also noticed that I'm using quite a lot of JS string interpolation with class names:

```jsx
<p className={`header-logo theme-${theme}-header-logo`}>calc</p>

<div className={`keypad theme-${theme}-keypad`}></div>

<div className={`display theme-${theme}-display`}>
  <p className={`display-text theme-${theme}-display-text`}>
    {value[value.length-1] === '.' ? value : parseFloat(Number(value).toFixed(7))}
  </p>
</div>
```

Here I'm actually applying at least two classes to all native DOM elements that will have some property that changes across different themes: 
- The first class styles the element's base properties: height/width, padding/margin, font size, Flex/Grid layout stuff, etc.
- The second class styles the theme-specific properties, mostly background and font colors.

The second class name is generated by interpolating a base name (e.g. `theme-X-logo`) with the theme value from the `useContext()` hook (e.g. `1`) to produce something like `theme-1-logo`, which brings to my second point.

### Theme-specific stylesheets

Thanks to Vite, you can import stylesheets into React components by simply using an simple `import` statements like so:

```jsx
// App.jsx

// ...

// theme stylesheets
import './css/theme-1.css'
import './css/theme-2.css'
import './css/theme-3.css'

// ...

```

As you've probably guessed, the three CSS files above contain the theme-specific styling rules. The colors were simply copied over from the style guide and pasted into variables in the `:root` pseudo-class. Then all that's left is to specify the theme-specific class names and apply the appropriate rules according to the style guide:

```css
:root {
  /* Backgrounds */
  /* (main background) */
  --very-dark-desaturated-blue-1: hsl(222, 26%, 31%);
  /* (toggle background, keypad background) */
  --very-dark-desaturated-blue-2: hsl(223, 31%, 20%);
  /* (screen background) */
  --very-dark-desaturated-blue-3: hsl(224, 36%, 15%);

  /* other colors omitted for simplicity... */
}

.theme-1-main {
  background-color: var(--very-dark-desaturated-blue-1);
}

.theme-1-header-logo {
  color: white;
}

.theme-1-header-switch-prompt {
  color: white;
}

.theme-1-header-switch-container {
  background-color: var(--very-dark-desaturated-blue-2);
}

.theme-1-header-switch-toggle {
  background-color: var(--red);
}

/* more styling... */
```
